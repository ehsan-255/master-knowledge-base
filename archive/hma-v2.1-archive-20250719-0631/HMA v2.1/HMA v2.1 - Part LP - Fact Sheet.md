        self.internal_engine = OptimalDomainEngine()      # OPTIONAL
    
    def process_request(self, request):
        # Ensure boundary compliance
        self.boundary_interface.validate(request)
        
        # Use optimal internal processing
        result = self.internal_engine.process(request)
        
        # Ensure compliant response
        return self.boundary_interface.format_response(result)
```

        # Ensure compliance maintained
        baseline_result = self.baseline.validate(data)
        
        # Add enhanced capabilities
        enhanced_result = self.enhanced.validate(data)
        
        return CombinedResult(baseline_result, enhanced_result)

# Phase 2: Optimize internally while maintaining boundaries
class OptimizedPlugin:
    def execute_hma_request(self, request):
        # BOUNDARY: Standard HMA compliance
        self.validate_hma_contract(request)
        
        # INTERNAL: Domain optimization
        result = self.optimized_processor.execute(request)

## Quick Architecture Decisions

### Technology Selection Flowchart
```yaml
decision_flow:
  step_1:
    question: "Do you have domain-specific requirements?"
    yes: "Consider domain-specific pattern"
    no: "Use standard pattern"
    
  step_2:
    question: "Can you implement compliance adapters?"
    yes: "Adopt optimal internal technologies"
    no: "Use standard technologies throughout"

HMA v2.1 transforms architectural standards from constraints into enablers. By distinguishing between essential interoperability requirements (boundaries) and optimization opportunities (implementation), it creates the first architectural standard that promotes innovation while ensuring compatibility.

The result: semantic systems can use SHACL, performance systems can use Protocol Buffers, AI systems can use ML-specific tools, and financial systems can use regulatory compliance technologies—all while maintaining perfect interoperability within the HMA ecosystem.

HMA v2.1 doesn't just allow optimal technology choices—it systematizes and encourages them through the Innovation Zones framework, making it the ideal foundation for domain-specific excellence within enterprise-grade architectural standards.
