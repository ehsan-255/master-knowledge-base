# Circuit Breaker Integration Test Results

**Date:** 2025-06-08 12:03  
**Action:** 2.2.3.2 - Integrate Circuit Breaker into ActionDispatcher  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## Test Summary

All circuit breaker integration tests passed successfully, confirming that the circuit breaker pattern has been properly integrated into the ActionDispatcher.

## Tests Executed

### 1. Circuit Breaker Configuration Extraction
- ✅ Custom circuit breaker configuration extracted correctly
- ✅ Default circuit breaker configuration used when none specified  
- ✅ Partial circuit breaker configuration merged with defaults correctly

### 2. Action Failure vs System Failure Distinction
- ✅ Action failures correctly ignored by circuit breaker
- ✅ Multiple action failures do not trigger circuit breaker
- ✅ Circuit breaker remains closed for action-level failures

### 3. Circuit Breaker Integration with System Failures
- ✅ First system failure recorded, circuit remains closed
- ✅ Second system failure opens circuit after threshold
- ✅ Third attempt blocked by open circuit breaker
- ✅ Recovery after timeout with successful action
- ✅ Circuit breaker closes after successful recovery

## Key Features Verified

1. **Circuit Breaker Manager Integration**: ActionDispatcher now includes a CircuitBreakerManager instance
2. **Rule-Level Circuit Breaking**: Each rule gets its own circuit breaker based on rule_id
3. **Configuration Support**: Circuit breaker settings can be configured per rule via error_handling.circuit_breaker
4. **Failure Type Distinction**: 
   - Action failures (expected) do not trigger circuit breaker
   - System failures (plugin loading, validation errors) do trigger circuit breaker
5. **State Management**: Proper transitions between CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED
6. **Statistics Integration**: Circuit breaker statistics exposed via get_execution_stats()
7. **Error Handling**: Proper synthetic error results for circuit breaker blocks and system failures

## Implementation Details

- **Files Modified**: `tools/scribe/core/action_dispatcher.py`
- **New Dependencies**: `CircuitBreakerManager`, `CircuitBreakerError` from `circuit_breaker.py`
- **New Methods Added**:
  - `_get_circuit_breaker_config()` - Extract circuit breaker config from rules
  - `_execute_actions_internal()` - Internal action execution wrapped by circuit breaker
  - `get_circuit_breaker_stats()` - Expose circuit breaker statistics
- **Enhanced Statistics**: Added `circuit_breaker_blocks` counter

## Circuit Breaker Behavior

- **Failure Threshold**: Default 5 failures (configurable per rule)
- **Recovery Timeout**: Default 60 seconds (configurable per rule)  
- **Success Threshold**: Default 3 successes to close from half-open (configurable per rule)
- **Scope**: Rule-level isolation (failures in one rule don't affect others)

## Conclusion

The circuit breaker integration is complete and functioning correctly. The ActionDispatcher now provides robust failure isolation at the rule level, preventing cascading failures while maintaining system stability.

**ACTION 2.2.3.2 STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED**
