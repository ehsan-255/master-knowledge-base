# Standards Consolidation Log - 2025-06-16 22:12

## Overview
This archive contains standards files that were consolidated to eliminate redundancy between CS-POLICY and AS-STRUCTURE documents.

## Consolidations Performed

### 1. AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER + CS-POLICY-DOC-CHAPTER-CONTENT
- **Primary Standard:** AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER (v2.0.0)
- **Archived Standard:** CS-POLICY-DOC-CHAPTER-CONTENT.md
- **Reason:** Both derived from U-STRUC-002 with overlapping structural requirements
- **Rules Merged:** Added rules 2.4 and 2.5 from CS-POLICY to AS-STRUCTURE
- **Domain Decision:** Retained AS (Architecture & Structure) domain

### 2. AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT + CS-POLICY-KB-ROOT  
- **Primary Standard:** AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT (v2.0.0)
- **Archived Standard:** CS-POLICY-KB-ROOT.md
- **Reason:** Both derived from U-ARCH-001 with overlapping consistency requirements
- **Rules Merged:** Added rule 1.6 with decision criteria from CS-POLICY to AS-STRUCTURE
- **Domain Decision:** Retained AS (Architecture & Structure) domain

## Standards NOT Consolidated
- **AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART + CS-POLICY-KB-PART-CONTENT:** Legitimate separation maintained
  - AS-STRUCTURE: Structural requirements (overview files, locations)
  - CS-POLICY: Content organization (sequencing, coherence)

## Impact
- Eliminated redundancy between 4 standards files
- Consolidated all U-STRUC-002 and U-ARCH-001 rules into cohesive AS-STRUCTURE standards
- Maintained clear domain separation between structure (AS) and content policies (CS)
- Updated cross-references throughout codebase
- Updated JSON-LD registry entries

## Cross-Reference Updates Required
All references to archived standards must be updated to point to the consolidated standards:
- CS-POLICY-DOC-CHAPTER-CONTENT → AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER
- CS-POLICY-KB-ROOT → AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT
