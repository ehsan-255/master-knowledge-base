## **üìù DETAILED PROGRESS ENTRIES**

### **Entry 1**: **20250608-2110** | **1.1.1**: Create and Activate Development Branch
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 1 minute

#### **üéØ What Was Done**
- Checked current git status (on main branch)
- Executed git pull (already up to date)
- Created new branch: `git checkout -b feature/scribe-refinements`
- Activated conda environment: `conda activate conda-kb`

#### **üìä Outcome**
- Successfully created and switched to `feature/scribe-refinements` branch
- Conda-kb environment is active and ready for development
- Development environment is properly isolated from main branch

#### **üí° Notes**
- Repository was already up to date with main
- Environment setup completed without issues
- Ready to proceed to STEP 1.2

---

### **Entry 2**: **20250608-2112** | **1.2.1**: Modify SecurityManager
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 1 minute

#### **üéØ What Was Done**
- Located SecurityManager at `tools/scribe/core/security_manager.py`
- Modified `execute_command_safely` method signature from `command: str` to `command_list: List[str]`
- Updated command validation to only validate first element (`command_list[0]`)
- Changed `subprocess.run` call to use `command_list` directly with `shell=False`
- Updated all logging and error handling to use `command_list` instead of `command`

#### **üìä Outcome**
- SecurityManager now uses safe `shell=False` execution
- Command injection vulnerability eliminated
- Method accepts list-based commands as required
- All error handling and logging updated consistently

#### **üí° Notes**
- Critical security fix implemented successfully
- No breaking changes to method interface beyond parameter type
- Ready to proceed to TASK 1.2.2

---

### **Entry 3**: **20250608-2114** | **1.2.2**: Update Action and Configuration for List-Based Commands
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 2 minutes

#### **üéØ What Was Done**
- Created new `run_command_action.py` in `tools/scribe/actions/`
- Implemented `RunCommandAction` class that uses SecurityManager's `execute_command_safely` method
- Added comprehensive parameter validation for list-based commands
- Updated `config/config.json` with new RULE-003 demonstrating list-based command format
- Example command: `["git", "status"]` instead of string format

#### **üìä Outcome**
- Action plugin properly constructs list of strings for commands
- Configuration demonstrates correct list-based format: `"command": ["git", "status"]`
- All security validations implemented for command parameters
- Example rule ready for testing list-based command execution

#### **üí° Notes**
- Action plugin follows BaseAction contract correctly
- Comprehensive error handling and logging implemented
- Ready to proceed to TASK 1.2.3 for testing

---

### **Entry 4**: **20250608-2117** | **1.2.3**: Update and Verify Tests
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 3 minutes

#### **üéØ What Was Done**
- Verified existing comprehensive SecurityManager test suite in `test_security_manager.py`
- Ran all 15 SecurityManager tests - all passed successfully
- Created and ran manual test script to verify list-based command functionality
- Verified critical `test_execute_command_safely_uses_shell_false` test passes
- Confirmed all PHASE 1 exit conditions are met

#### **üìä Outcome**
- All SecurityManager tests pass (15/15)
- Critical test confirms `subprocess.run` is called with `shell=False`
- Manual test verifies list-based commands work correctly
- Security violations properly raised for invalid commands
- PHASE 1 exit conditions fully satisfied

#### **üí° Notes**
- Test failures in other modules (atomic_write) are unrelated to SecurityManager changes
- Manual test shows expected behavior with environment scrubbing
- All security requirements successfully implemented and verified
- PHASE 1: Critical Security Hardening is now COMPLETE

---

### **Entry 5**: **20250608-2257** | **4.1**: Implement Action Chain Failure Handling
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 55 minutes

#### **üéØ What Was Done**
- Added `ActionChainFailedError` exception class to `action_dispatcher.py`
- Modified `_execute_actions_internal` method to raise `ActionChainFailedError` when action chains fail
- Updated action chain failure logic to use new exception instead of `ActionExecutionError`
- Created comprehensive test suite `test_phase4_verification.py` to verify circuit breaker functionality
- Fixed test configuration to match proper Scribe config schema requirements

#### **üìä Outcome**
- `ActionChainFailedError` properly implemented with rule_id, failed_actions, and total_actions parameters
- Circuit breaker correctly opens after 5 consecutive action chain failures
- Test demonstrates ActionChainFailedError is caught by circuit breaker and triggers state change
- Comprehensive logging shows circuit breaker state transitions from CLOSED to OPEN
- PHASE 4 exit conditions fully satisfied

#### **üí° Notes**
- Initial validation revealed Phase 4 was previously incomplete despite claims in tracking documents
- ActionChainFailedError was missing from codebase but now properly implemented
- Test output saved to tools/reports/ as per work ethic guidelines
- Circuit breaker opens exactly as specified in roadmap requirements
- PHASE 4: Refine Circuit Breaker Logic is now COMPLETE

## **üö® ISSUE TRACKING** (Only used when BLOCKED status occurs)

### **Issue [#]**: [Issue Title]
**Identified**: [YYYYMMDD-HHMM]
**Severity**: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]
**Status**: [OPEN/IN PROGRESS/RESOLVED]
**Affected Items**: [List of blocked roadmap items]

#### **üîç Description**
[Detailed description of the blocking issue]

#### **üìà Impact**
[How this affects project timeline and execution]

#### **üõ†Ô∏è Resolution**
[Actions taken to resolve the issue]
**Resolved**: [YYYYMMDD-HHMM]

---

### **üö® MANDATORY TIMESTAMP REQUIREMENTS**

#### **TIMESTAMP FORMAT**: **YYYYMMDD-HHMM** (NO DEVIATIONS ALLOWED)
- **Example**: 20241205-1430 (December 5, 2024 at 2:30 PM)
- **System Extraction**: ALWAYS extract current timestamp from system using terminal commands
- **Terminal Command**: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"` (use this exact format)
- **NO MANUAL TIMESTAMPS**: Never manually type timestamps - always extract from system

#### **DURATION CALCULATIONS**
- **Primary Unit**: Minutes (for tasks under 60 minutes)
- **Secondary Unit**: Hours (for tasks 1+ hours, format: "2.5 hours")  
- **Tertiary Unit**: Days (rarely used, format: "1.2 days")
- **NO TARGET DATES**: Focus on actual execution times only

---

### **üîÑ CONTINUOUS EXECUTION PROTOCOL**

#### **AFTER EACH ITEM COMPLETION**
1. **Extract system timestamp** using terminal command
2. **Add completion entry** to appropriate log section
3. **Update timeline table** (Standard/Comprehensive only)
4. **Update metrics** (Standard/Comprehensive only)
5. **Keep entries brief** - focus on essential information only

#### **‚õî ONLY WHEN BLOCKED**
1. **Log issue** in Issue Tracking section
2. **Update item status** to BLOCKED in timeline
3. **Document resolution** when issue is resolved
4. **Extract resolution timestamp** from system

---

### **üëçüèº BEST PRACTICES**

- **Immediate updates** - log completion immediately after finishing an item
- **System timestamps** - never estimate or manually type timestamps. Always extract from system
- **Brief entries** - focus on outcomes and key points only
- **Issue focus** - only track significant blocking issues
- **Consistent format** - maintain template structure throughout execution

---

### **COORDINATION**
- **This progress tracker** is for detailed completion documentation
- **Checklist** is for quick status updates and brief notes
- **Main roadmap** remains the authoritative source for execution instructions

>**NO OTHER REPORTING, TRACKING, OR DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED FOR A ROADMAP**
