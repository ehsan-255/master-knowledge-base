# PROJECT EXECUTION ROADMAP

>**THE "*🚨 MANDATORY* ROADMAP PROGRESS MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL" *MUST* BE FOLLOWED AND UPDATED AT ALL TIMES TO ENSURE THE PROGRESS IS ACTIVELY TRACKED AND WORK CAN BE RESUMED FROM THE SAME POINT WITHOUT CAUSING ANY CONFUSION AND REDUNDANCY, THE PROGRESS MUST BE UPDATED CONTINUOUSLY WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION**

>**UPDATE THE CHECKLIST CONTINUOUSLY AT ALL TIMES WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION**

⬜ ## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Scribe Engine Refinements & Hardening**: This project will implement critical security fixes, foundational structural improvements, and operational resilience enhancements identified in the Scribe codebase analysis. The purpose is to elevate the existing high-quality codebase to a production-grade standard by closing security gaps, improving maintainability, and enhancing observability. The outcome will be a safer, more robust, and more debuggable Scribe engine.

---

⬜ ## PHASE 1: Critical Security Hardening (P=1)
- **Purpose**: To eliminate the critical `shell=True` vulnerability in the `SecurityManager`.
- **Scope**: Modifying the command execution logic, updating relevant configurations, and verifying the fix with targeted tests.
- **Outcome**: A Scribe engine that is protected against shell injection attacks.

⬜ ### STEP 1.1: Environment Setup and Branching (S=1)
- **Purpose**: To prepare the development environment for the refinement work, ensuring isolation from the `main` branch.
- **Outcome**: A new Git branch created from `main` and a verified Conda environment.

⬜ #### TASK 1.1.1: Create and Activate Development Branch (T=1)
- 🎬 In your terminal, from the repository root, execute the following commands:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull
  git checkout -b feature/scribe-refinements
  conda activate conda-kb
  ```

---

⬜ ### STEP 1.2: Refactor Command Execution to Eliminate `shell=True` (S=2)
- **Purpose**: To replace the `shell=True` pattern with a safer, list-based command execution model.
- **Outcome**: The `SecurityManager` uses `shell=False`, and all dependent components are updated accordingly.

⬜ #### TASK 1.2.1: Modify `SecurityManager` (T=1)
- 🎬 Open `tools/scribe/core/security_manager.py`.
- 🎬 Locate the `execute_command_safely` method.
- 🎬 Change the method signature from `command: str` to `command_list: List[str]`.
- 🎬 Modify the `subprocess.run` call to pass `command_list` directly and set `shell=False`.
- 🎬 Update the internal `validate_command` call to only validate the first element of the list (`command_list[0]`).

⬜ #### TASK 1.2.2: Update Action and Configuration for List-Based Commands (T=2)
- 🎬 Locate the action plugin that executes commands (e.g., a hypothetical `run_command_action.py`).
- 🎬 Update its `execute` method to construct a list of strings for the command instead of a single string.
- 🎬 Update the `config/config.json` to reflect this change. The `command` parameter for such actions should now be an array of strings.
  ```json
  // Example change in config.json
  "params": {
    "command": ["git", "status"] 
  }
  ```

⬜ #### TASK 1.2.3: Update and Verify Tests (T=3)
- 🎬 Open the relevant test file for the `SecurityManager` (e.g., `test_security_manager.py`, which may need to be created if not present).
- 🎬 Write a new test that specifically asserts `subprocess.run` is called with `shell=False`.
- 🎬 Update existing tests for command execution to use the new list-based format.
- 🎬 Run all tests to ensure no regressions were introduced: `python -m pytest`.

---

⬜ **🏁 PHASE 1 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
⬜ **CONDITION 1**: The `execute_command_safely` method in `security_manager.py` exclusively uses `subprocess.run` with `shell=False`.
⬜ **CONDITION 2**: All tests related to command execution pass successfully.
⬜ **CONDITION 3**: A manual test confirms that a command defined as a list in `config.json` executes correctly.

---

⬜ ## PHASE 2: Python Packaging and Import Refactoring (P=2)
- **Purpose**: To eliminate `sys.path` manipulations by structuring Scribe as a proper, installable Python package.
- **Scope**: Creating a `pyproject.toml`, installing the package in editable mode, and refactoring all local imports.
- **Outcome**: A more robust and maintainable project structure that follows Python packaging best practices.

⬜ ### STEP 2.1: Implement Python Packaging (S=1)
- 🎬 In the `tools/scribe/` directory, create a `pyproject.toml` file with the following content:
  ```toml
  [project]
  name = "scribe-engine"
  version = "1.0.1"
  description = "Scribe Automation Engine"
  requires-python = ">=3.9"
  dependencies = [
      "watchdog>=3.0.0",
      "structlog>=23.0.0",
      "pyyaml>=6.0",
      "jsonschema>=4.0.0",
      "psutil>=5.9.0",
  ]

  [build-system]
  requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
  build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
  ```
- 🎬 From the `tools/scribe/` directory, install the package in editable mode:
  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```

⬜ ### STEP 2.2: Refactor All Local Imports (S=2)
- 🎬 Systematically go through the Scribe codebase and replace all `sys.path.insert(...)` hacks with standard absolute imports.
- 🎬 In `tools/scribe/actions/base.py`, change the import to `from scribe.core.logging_config import get_scribe_logger`.
- 🎬 In `tools/scribe/core/action_dispatcher.py`, change the import to `from scribe.actions.base import BaseAction, ...`.
- 🎬 In `tools/scribe/core/plugin_loader.py`, change the import to `from scribe.actions.base import BaseAction`.
- 🎬 Verify that all other local imports now work correctly (e.g., `from core.logging_config...` becomes `from scribe.core.logging_config...`).

⬜ ### STEP 2.3: Update Documentation and Test Execution (S=3)
- 🎬 Update `tools/scribe/README.md` to reflect the new installation step (`pip install -e .`).
- 🎬 Ensure the test runner (`pytest`) still works correctly from the `test-environment/scribe-tests` directory without any `sys.path` modifications in the test files themselves.

---

⬜ **🏁 PHASE 2 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
⬜ **CONDITION 1**: The Scribe engine runs successfully after being installed with `pip install -e .`.
⬜ **CONDITION 2**: No `sys.path.insert` calls remain in the Scribe application source code.
⬜ **CONDITION 3**: All tests pass without any import-related errors.

---

⬜ ## PHASE 3: Enhance Logging with Event Traceability (P=3)
- **Purpose**: To introduce a unique `event_id` to trace a single file event across the entire processing pipeline.
- **Scope**: Modifying the `Watcher`, `Worker`, and `ActionDispatcher` to generate and propagate a unique ID.
- **Outcome**: Greatly improved debuggability via correlated log entries.

⬜ ### STEP 3.1: Implement `event_id` Generation and Propagation (S=1)
- 🎬 Open `tools/scribe/watcher.py`. In the `_queue_event` method, import the `uuid` module and add a unique ID to the event data dictionary: `event_data['event_id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())`.
- 🎬 Open `tools/scribe/worker.py`. In the `_process_event` method, extract the `event_id` from the event dictionary.
- 🎬 Use `logger.bind(event_id=event_id)` to create a context-specific logger for the duration of the event processing. Pass this logger to the `ActionDispatcher`.
- 🎬 Open `tools/scribe/core/action_dispatcher.py`. Modify its methods to accept and use the bound logger from the `Worker`, ensuring the `event_id` is present in all logs related to that event's actions.

⬜ ### STEP 3.2: Verify End-to-End Traceability (S=2)
- 🎬 Run an integration test that modifies a file and triggers a rule.
- 🎬 Capture the log output and use a tool like `jq` to filter for a single `event_id`.
- 🎬 🎬 Action: `cat log_output.json | jq 'select(.event_id == "the-specific-id")'`.
- 🎬 Confirm that all log entries for that event, from initial detection in the `Watcher` to final action completion in the `ActionDispatcher`, share the same `event_id`.

---

⬜ **🏁 PHASE 3 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
⬜ **CONDITION 1**: All log entries related to the processing of a single file event contain a matching, unique `event_id`.

---

⬜ ## PHASE 4: Refine Circuit Breaker Logic (P=4)
- **Purpose**: To make the circuit breaker more sensitive to persistent, non-fatal action failures.
- **Scope**: Modifying the `ActionDispatcher` to raise a specific error when any action in a chain fails, which the `CircuitBreaker` can then count.
- **Outcome**: A more resilient engine that can detect and isolate "flappy" rules.

⬜ ### STEP 4.1: Implement Action Chain Failure Handling (S=1)
- 🎬 In `tools/scribe/core/action_dispatcher.py`, define a new custom exception, e.g., `class ActionChainFailedError(Exception): pass`.
- 🎬 In the `_execute_actions_internal` method, after the loop that processes all actions, check if any of the `action_results` have `success=False`.
- 🎬 If any action failed, `raise ActionChainFailedError("One or more actions failed in the chain.")`. This exception will now be caught by the `CircuitBreaker`'s `execute` wrapper.

⬜ ### STEP 4.2: Update Tests for Circuit Breaker (S=2)
- 🎬 Create a new integration test that configures a rule with an action that is designed to always fail.
- 🎬 Trigger the rule multiple times (e.g., more than the `failure_threshold`).
- 🎬 Assert that the `CircuitBreaker` transitions to the `OPEN` state.

---

⬜ **🏁 PHASE 4 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
⬜ **CONDITION 1**: The new integration test successfully demonstrates that a rule with a consistently failing action causes its corresponding circuit breaker to open.

---

⬜ ## PHASE 5: Implement Queue Backpressure (P=5)
- **Purpose**: To prevent high memory consumption when the watcher produces events faster than the worker can consume them.
- **Scope**: Modifying the `ScribeEngine` constructor to use a bounded queue.
- **Outcome**: A more memory-stable engine under high event load.

⬜ ### STEP 5.1: Enforce Bounded Queue (S=1)
- 🎬 Open `tools/scribe/engine.py`. In the `ScribeEngine.__init__` method, ensure the `queue.Queue` is initialized with the `maxsize` parameter: `self.event_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=queue_maxsize)`.
- 🎬 The `Watcher` already correctly uses `put_nowait()` and logs a warning on `queue.Full`. This step is to ensure the `Engine` enforces the bound.

⬜ ### STEP 5.2: Create and Verify Backpressure Test (S=2)
- 🎬 Create a new test in `test-environment/scribe-tests` that simulates a high-volume event burst.
- 🎬 The test should initialize the engine with a small `queue_maxsize` (e.g., 10).
- 🎬 It should then rapidly create/modify more than 10 files.
- 🎬 Assert that the log output contains the "Event queue is full, dropping event" warning message from the `Watcher`.

---

⬜ **🏁 PHASE 5 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
⬜ **CONDITION 1**: The backpressure test successfully generates the "queue is full" warning in the logs, confirming the bounded queue is working as expected.

---

⬜ **🏁 PROJECT EXIT CONDITIONS**: [Final Completion Criteria for Entire Project] (C=1)
⬜ **CONDITION 1**: All phases (1-5) are marked as complete.
⬜ **CONDITION 2**: The entire test suite, including all new tests, passes with 100% success.
⬜ **CONDITION 3**: The `feature/scribe-refinements` branch is reviewed, approved, and successfully merged into the `main` branch.
