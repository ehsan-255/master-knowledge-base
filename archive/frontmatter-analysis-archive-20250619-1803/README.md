## REMAINING ACTIVE ISSUES

**NOTE:** The following files were NOT archived and contain unresolved issues requiring immediate attention:

1. **comprehensive-standards-analysis-remaining-tasks-20250616-2101.md**
   - Verified LLM schema duplication issues
   - Weak mandating language requiring strengthening
   - Missing enforcement standards

2. **frontmatter-implementation-damage-assessment-20250617-1328.md**
   - Critical operational failure identification
   - Technical implementation completed but never deployed
   - Contains actionable deployment roadmap

## OPERATIONAL STATUS

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- All frontmatter enhancement infrastructure implemented
- Document type analyzer, SHACL validation, LLM integration all exist
- GitHub Actions workflow created

**OPERATIONAL DEPLOYMENT:** ❌ **FAILED**  
- No implementation components are actively deployed
- GitHub Actions workflow explicitly disabled (`ENABLE_FRONTMATTER_VALIDATION: false`)
- Repository exhibits identical systemic issues as before implementation

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** Deploy and activate existing frontmatter enhancement infrastructure
