Refactor: Finalize Phase B - Tools, Data Validation, and progress.md Update

This commit concludes Phase B of the standards refactoring project, focusing on the productionization of the `kb_linter.py` and `generate_index.py` tools, and performing extensive automated and targeted manual data corrections to align content with documented standards. This effort has significantly improved data quality and tool reliability. This commit also includes updates to progress.md reflecting the completion status of Phase B.

**I. Tooling Enhancements & Configuration:**

1.  **`standard_id` Regex Alignment:**
    *   The `STANDARD_ID_REGEX` in `kb_linter.py` and the `standard_id` pattern in `standards_index.schema.json` were updated to `^[A-Z]{2}-[A-Z0-9]+(?:-[A-Z0-9]+)*$`. This enforces all-uppercase `standard_id`s with a `DOMAIN-RestOfID` structure, where `RestOfID` can be multi-segmented with hyphens and alphanumeric characters.

2.  **Linter (`kb_linter.py`):**
    *   Updated mandatory key logic, path-based link erroring, regex group unpacking, `README.md`, and dummy file data.

3.  **Indexer (`generate_index.py`):**
    *   Added `argparse` for configurability, multi-directory scan support (`--src-dirs`), debug output, and updated `README.md`.

4.  **New & Updated Utility Scripts (`master-knowledge-base/tools/`):**
    *   `refactor_ids_filenames.py`: Uppercased `standard_id`s and filenames. Run.
    *   `refactor_criticality_field.py`: Lowercased `criticality:` field values. Run.
    *   `refactor_tag_casing.py`: (User-fixed) Lowercased `criticality/*` tags. Run.
    *   `crlf_to_lf_converter.py`: Converted `.md` file line endings to LF. Run.
    *   `populate_changelog_fm.py`: (User-fixed) Adds/updates frontmatter for changelogs using `ruamel.yaml` for order. Run with `--force`.

**II. Data Corrections & Standard Alignments:**

*   `standard_id` and Filename Casing: Addressed.
*   Changelog Frontmatter: Populated for ~75 files with improved key order.
*   CRLF Line Endings: Addressed; linter reports significantly fewer warnings.
*   `sub_domain` Corrections: `subdomain_registry.yaml` updated. Relevant files updated.
*   Tag & Field Casing for `criticality`: Addressed.
*   Path-Based Links: Major instances fixed or commented with TODOs. Some guides still require manual path verification for non-standard doc links.
*   Example Links & Tags: Clarified/Corrected.

**III. Current State & Remaining Issues (Post `linter_report_final_v5.md`):**

*   Indexer: Successfully indexes 304 files; index is schema-valid.
*   Linter Errors: 3 (all path-based links in guide files requiring manual path verification by user).
*   Linter Warnings (128): Primarily key order in changelogs (due to `populate_changelog_fm.py` YAML dump behavior - needs further refinement of the script if 100% order is desired) and some filename/`standard_id` mismatches for changelogs (potential linter/OS case interaction or needs one more cycle of rename script then linter).

**IV. Next Steps (User Action Required Post-Phase B):**

1.  Manually Correct Remaining 3 Path-Based Link Errors in guide files.
2.  Optionally refine `populate_changelog_fm.py` for perfect key order if warnings persist and are deemed critical.
3.  Address other minor warnings from `linter_report_final_v5.md` as needed.

This iterative process has dramatically improved data quality and tool reliability, establishing a solid foundation.
