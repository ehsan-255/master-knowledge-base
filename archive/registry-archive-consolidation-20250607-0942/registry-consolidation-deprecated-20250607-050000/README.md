# Archived Registry Files (20250607-050000)

These files were deprecated as part of the registry consolidation project (see `registry-consolidation-roadmap.md`).
Their content has been integrated into:
- `master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/mt-schema-frontmatter.yaml`
- `master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/mt-registry-tag-glossary.yaml`

The .txt files were generated from these YAMLs prior to consolidation. Their generation logic has been updated in `master-knowledge-base/tools/frontmatter-management/generate_frontmatter_registry.py` to use the new consolidated sources.
