# PROJECT EXECUTION ROADMAP

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Purpose**: To execute the five critical remediation tasks identified in recent standards audits, bringing the repository back into full alignment with its architectural and operational principles.
**Scope**: The project impacts standards documents (`standards/src/`), architectural documents (`AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB.md`, `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md`), and requires the development of new automation scripts.
**Outcome**: A more robust, consistent, and maintainable knowledge base with reduced technical debt and improved automation coverage.

## PHASE P1: Correct Invalid References in Active Standards
- **Brief Description**: This phase will find and replace all references to obsolete collection documents (`COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md`, `COL-LINKING-UNIVERSAL.md`) within the 12 affected standards files. This is a high-precision task requiring scripting and manual validation.
- GOTO P1.1

---

**üèÅ PHASE P1 EXIT CONDITIONS**: Successful correction of all 12 files.
**CONDITION C1**: A `grep` search for the obsolete filenames (`COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md`, `COL-LINKING-UNIVERSAL.md`) returns zero results within the `standards/src/` directory.
**CONDITION C2**: A commit containing the 12 corrected files is successfully pushed to the repository.
- IF CONDITIONS TRUE: GOTO P2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP

---

### P1.1: Identify Affected Files & Map Rules
- **Brief Description**: This sub-phase involves the initial investigation: pinpointing the exact files and lines containing invalid references and then creating a definitive mapping from the old, deprecated rules to their new, atomic standard counterparts.
- GOTO P1.1.1

---

**üèÅ P1.1 EXIT CONDITIONS**: A complete and verified mapping document is created.
**CONDITION C1**: A script performing a `grep` or `Select-String` search successfully identifies and logs the 12 affected files.
**CONDITION C2**: A mapping document (e.g., `remediation-mapping.json`) is created that explicitly links each obsolete rule reference to its new standard ID. This mapping must be manually verified for accuracy.
- IF CONDITIONS TRUE: GOTO P1.2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP

---

#### P1.1.1: Develop Correction Script
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: Develop a Python script that reads the mapping document created in P1.1 and is capable of replacing the invalid reference sentences in the 12 target files with the corrected text pointing to the new standards. The script must include a `--dry-run` flag.

---

#### P1.1.2: Execute and Verify Correction
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: Execute the correction script. First, run with `--dry-run` to log proposed changes. After verification, run the script in live mode. Finally, manually spot-check at least 3 of the 12 modified files to ensure the replacement was successful and grammatically correct.

---

## PHASE P2: System-wide Removal of Changelog Metadata
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: Execute the system-wide removal of the `change_log_url` key from the frontmatter of all 68 standards documents where it exists by developing and running a Python script. The script must first perform a dry run before executing the removal.

---

**üèÅ PHASE P2 EXIT CONDITIONS**: Complete removal of the `change_log_url` key from all relevant files.
**CONDITION C1**: A `grep` search for `change_log_url:` returns zero results within the `standards/src/` directory.
**CONDITION C2**: A commit containing the 68 corrected files is successfully pushed to the repository.
- IF CONDITIONS TRUE: GOTO P3; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP

---

## PHASE P3: Establish and Execute Draft Promotion Process
- **Brief Description**: This phase formalizes the quality gate for promoting the 55 standards currently in `draft` status. It involves creating a new standard for the review process itself and setting up the necessary tracking artifacts. The execution of the reviews is a separate, larger effort that this phase enables.
- GOTO P3.1

---

**üèÅ PHASE P3 EXIT CONDITIONS**: The formal review process and its required artifacts are created and ready for use.
**CONDITION C1**: A new standard document, `SA-PROCESS-DRAFT-REVIEW`, is created, finalized, and marked as `status/active`.
**CONDITION C2**: A master tracking sheet (e.g., `audit-remediation-initiative-draft-tracker.csv`) is created in the project directory, populated with the list of all 55 draft files.
- IF CONDITIONS TRUE: GOTO P4; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP

---

### P3.1: Formalize "Expert Review Checklist"
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: Create and ratify the `SA-PROCESS-DRAFT-REVIEW` standard. It must contain the mandatory "Expert Review Checklist" including checks for completeness, link integrity, reference validity, linter compliance, and logical soundness.

---

### P3.2: Create Master Tracking Sheet
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: Create the master tracking sheet listing all 55 draft files and their domains. This will serve as the queue for the review process.

---

## PHASE P4: Develop Architectural Synchronization Tool
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: Create a new script at `tools/builder/update_architecture_docs.py` that automates the updating of `AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB.md` and `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` by consuming data from the correctly-pathed `standards/registry/master-index.jsonld`.

---

**üèÅ PHASE P4 EXIT CONDITIONS**: A functioning and integrated architectural synchronization script.
**CONDITION C1**: The script at `tools/builder/update_architecture_docs.py` runs successfully without errors.
**CONDITION C2**: The script correctly updates the counts in `AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB.md` and the navigation links in `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` based on the live index file.
**CONDITION C3**: The script is successfully integrated into the main build process to run immediately after `generate_index.py`.
- IF CONDITIONS TRUE: GOTO P5; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP

---

## PHASE P5: Correct Document Tagging and Taxonomy
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: Align document metadata and navigation with established architectural principles. This involves manually editing `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` to remove an incorrect tag and enhancing the script from P4 to handle concept documents separately.

---

**üèÅ PROJECT EXIT CONDITIONS**: All five remediation tasks are fully completed and verified.
**CONDITION C1**: P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 are all marked complete with all exit conditions met.
**CONDITION C2**: The project initiative folder (`-audit-remediation-initiative-active/`) is ready for final review and archival.
- IF CONDITIONS TRUE: GOTO TOP
