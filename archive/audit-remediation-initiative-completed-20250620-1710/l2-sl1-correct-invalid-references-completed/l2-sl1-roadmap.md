# PROJECT EXECUTION ROADMAP

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Purpose**: To execute Phase 1 of the Audit Remediation Initiative.
**Scope**: This sub-project is strictly limited to finding and replacing all references to the obsolete collection documents (`COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md`, `COL-LINKING-UNIVERSAL.md`) within the 12 affected standards files.
**Outcome**: All 12 files are corrected, and the repository is free of these specific invalid references.

---

## PHASE P1: Identify and Map
- **Brief Description**: This phase covers the initial investigation: pinpointing the exact files and lines containing invalid references and then creating a definitive mapping from the old, deprecated rules to their new, atomic standard counterparts.
- GOTO P1.1

---

**üèÅ PHASE P1 EXIT CONDITIONS**: A complete and verified mapping document is created.
**CONDITION C1**: A script performing a `grep` or `Select-String` search successfully identifies and logs the 12 affected files.
**CONDITION C2**: A mapping document (e.g., `l2-sl1-remediation-mapping.json`) is created in this directory that explicitly links each obsolete rule reference to its new standard ID.
**CONDITION C3**: The mapping document is manually verified for accuracy against the standards' history.
- IF CONDITIONS TRUE: GOTO P2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP

---

### P1.1: Identify Affected Files
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: Execute a `grep` (or `Select-String` in PowerShell) search across the `standards/src/` directory for the strings `COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md` and `COL-LINKING-UNIVERSAL.md`. Log the full path of the 12 affected files to a temporary text file in `tools/reports/`.

---

### P1.2: Map Old Rules to New Standards
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: For each of the 12 files identified in P1.1, perform a detailed analysis of the broken reference. Manually trace the history of that rule set to identify the corresponding new, atomic standard(s) that now contain this logic. Populate `l2-sl1-remediation-mapping.json` with these findings.

---

## PHASE P2: Correct and Verify
- **Brief Description**: This phase involves the creation and execution of a script to programmatically correct the invalid references based on the mapping from Phase 1.
- GOTO P2.1

---

**üèÅ PHASE P2 EXIT CONDITIONS**: All 12 files are corrected and the sub-project is complete.
**CONDITION C1**: The correction script executes successfully.
**CONDITION C2**: A final `grep` search for the obsolete filenames returns zero results in `standards/src/`.
**CONDITION C3**: A commit is made containing the 12 corrected files, the new script, and the mapping file.
- IF CONDITIONS TRUE: GOTO TOP; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP

---

### P2.1: Develop Correction Script
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: Develop a Python script (`tools/refactoring-scripts/correct_collection_references.py`). The script must:
    1. Read the `l2-sl1-remediation-mapping.json` file.
    2. Iterate through the 12 affected files.
    3. For each file, replace the sentence containing the invalid reference with a corrected sentence pointing to the new standard(s).
    4. Include a `--dry-run` flag that logs intended changes to the console.

---

### P2.2: Execute and Verify Correction
- üé¨ **Actionable Instruction**: Execute the correction script. First, run with `--dry-run` to log proposed changes. After verification, run the script in live mode. Finally, manually spot-check at least 3 of the 12 modified files to ensure the replacement was successful.
