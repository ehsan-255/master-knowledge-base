# Refactoring Process: Preparation & Planning

We are currently undertaking a comprehensive refactoring of this repository. To ensure you are fully equipped to plan and execute the next phase, please follow the steps below to gather and synthesize all relevant information:

## 1. Review Key Documents

To gain a thorough understanding of the projectâ€™s current state, history, and future direction, carefully review the following documents:

- **Refactor Roadmap**  
  Open `_temp/Refactor Roadmap.md` to understand the original plan for the refactoring process, including objectives, milestones, and deliverables.

- **Refactoring Completion Report**  
  Open `_temp/refactoring-completion-report.md` to review the analysis and outcomes of the completed steps from the original roadmap. Pay attention to lessons learned, challenges encountered, and recommendations for future work.

- **Refactoring Completion Roadmap**  
  Open `_temp/refactoring-completion-roadmap.md` to familiarize yourself with the updated roadmap toward the official completion of the refactoring project. Note any changes in priorities, scope, or timelines.

- **Commit Messages**  
  Review all recent commit messages to track incremental changes, bug fixes, and feature additions. This will help you understand the current codebase status and ongoing work.

## 2. Synthesize Your Understanding

As you review the materials above, take notes on the following:

- Key objectives and deliverables for the refactoring project.
- Major milestones already achieved and those remaining.
- Any technical or organizational challenges highlighted in the reports.
- Dependencies or prerequisites for upcoming phases.
- Changes in scope, priorities, or timelines compared to the original plan.

## 3. Next Steps: Phase B Planning

With a comprehensive understanding of the project, proceed to plan the execution of the next major phase:

**Phase B: Linter & Indexer Productionization & Initial Source Validation (within `/master-knowledge-base/`)**

- Identify all tasks and sub-tasks required for Phase B.
- Determine resource requirements (tools, documentation).
- Establish clear milestones for each of the steps.
- Highlight any risks or uncertainties and propose mitigation strategies.
- Prepare any questions or clarifications needed from stakeholders before execution.

**Summary:**  
By thoroughly reviewing the specified documents and synthesizing your findings, you will be able to confidently plan and execute Phase B of the refactoring project. Ensure all insights and action items are documented for reference and team alignment.
