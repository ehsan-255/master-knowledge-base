# PROJECT EXECUTION ROADMAP: AUDIT REMEDIATION R2

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Purpose**: To execute a new, systematic, and highly verifiable remediation project to correct the critical failures identified in the `audit-remediation-execution-quality-20250621-0000.md` report.
**Scope**: This project will modify specific remediation scripts, create new ones, execute them in a verifiable sequence, and create a final validation tool to ensure 100% success.
**Outcome**: A correctly remediated repository state that aligns with all architectural and quality standards, and a new master verification script to prevent future failures.

---

## PHASE P1: PROJECT INITIALIZATION
- **Brief Description**: Establish the formal project structure within the repository to ensure proper tracking and documentation of the R2 initiative.

### P1.1: Create Project Directory
- üé¨ Create a new directory: `active-project/-audit-remediation-r2-active`.

### P1.2: Create Tracking Documents
- üé¨ Create `master-roadmap-r2.md` (this file), `checklist-audit-remediation-r2.md`, and `progress-tracker-audit-remediation-r2.md` in the new project directory.

---
**üèÅ PHASE P1 EXIT CONDITIONS**: The R2 project is formally established.
**CONDITION C1**: The `active-project/-audit-remediation-r2-active` directory exists.
**CONDITION C2**: The three core project documents (roadmap, checklist, progress tracker) exist in the new directory.
---

## PHASE P2: REMEDIATE P1 (Correct Invalid References)
- **Brief Description**: Fix the flawed `correct_collection_references.py` script and execute it to successfully remove all obsolete collection document references.

### P2.1: Enhance Remediation Script
- üé¨ Modify `tools/refactoring-scripts/correct_collection_references.py` to remove the hardcoded mapping file path. The script must be able to locate the mapping file within the active project structure.
- üé¨ Replace the brittle `.replace()` string replacement function with a robust regular expression (`re.sub`) based approach to guarantee matching.

### P2.2: Execute Script
- üé¨ Perform a `--dry-run` and redirect the output to a log file in `tools/reports/`.
- üé¨ Manually inspect the dry-run log to confirm all 11 previously missed files are correctly targeted for change.
- üé¨ Execute the script in 'live' mode.

---
**üèÅ PHASE P2 EXIT CONDITIONS**: All obsolete references to `COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md` and `COL-LINKING-UNIVERSAL.md` are removed from `standards/src/`.
**CONDITION C1**: The `correct_collection_references.py` script is updated with the new logic.
**CONDITION C2**: A `grep` search for the obsolete filenames returns zero (0) results within the `standards/src/` directory.
---

## PHASE P3: REMEDIATE P2 (Remove Changelog Metadata)
- **Brief Description**: Debug the failed `remove_changelog_metadata.py` script and execute it to remove all instances of the `change_log_url` key from standards frontmatter.

### P3.1: Debug and Fix Script
- üé¨ Analyze `tools/refactoring-scripts/remove_changelog_metadata.py` to identify the bug preventing it from removing the key from all files.
- üé¨ Implement a fix for the identified bug.

### P3.2: Execute Script
- üé¨ Perform a `--dry-run` to verify that the fixed script correctly targets all remaining 32+ files containing the `change_log_url` key.
- üé¨ Execute the script in 'live' mode.

---
**üèÅ PHASE P3 EXIT CONDITIONS**: All `change_log_url` keys are removed from the frontmatter of all files in `standards/src/`.
**CONDITION C1**: The `remove_changelog_metadata.py` script is updated with the fix.
**CONDITION C2**: A `grep` search for `change_log_url:` returns zero (0) results within the `standards/src/` directory.
---

## PHASE P4: REMEDIATE P3 (Restore Draft Standards)
- **Brief Description**: Create and execute a new script to programmatically restore the 47 draft standards to their correct `draft` status, fixing the critical failure from the previous project.

### P4.1: Develop New Restoration Script
- üé¨ Create a new script file: `tools/refactoring-scripts/restore_draft_status.py`.
- üé¨ Implement logic for the script to read the list of 47 files from `archive/audit-remediation-initiative-completed-20250620-1710/l2-sl3-establish-draft-promotion-process-completed/draft-standards-tracking-sheet.md`.
- üé¨ Implement logic to parse the YAML frontmatter of each of the 47 files and change the value of `status` from `active` to `draft`.

### P4.2: Execute Script
- üé¨ Perform a `--dry-run` to log which files will have their status changed.
- üé¨ Execute the script in 'live' mode.

---
**üèÅ PHASE P4 EXIT CONDITIONS**: The repository is restored to the state where 47 standards are correctly marked as `draft`.
**CONDITION C1**: The `restore_draft_status.py` script is created.
**CONDITION C2**: A command to count files with `status/draft` in `standards/src/` returns a value of exactly **47**.
---

## PHASE P5: REMEDIATE P4 & P5 (Synchronize Architecture)
- **Brief Description**: Execute the existing (but previously un-run) architectural synchronization tool to update the key architectural documents. This single phase remediates two previous failures.

### P5.1: Execute Synchronization Tool
- üé¨ Execute `tools/builder/update_architecture_docs.py` with the `--dry-run` flag and review the output.
- üé¨ Execute `tools/builder/update_architecture_docs.py` in 'live' mode.

---
**üèÅ PHASE P5 EXIT CONDITIONS**: The primary architectural documents are fully synchronized with the master index.
**CONDITION C1**: The `LastWriteTime` timestamp for both `AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB.md` and `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` is updated to the time of script execution.
**CONDITION C2**: The content of `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` now includes a populated list of links under the `### 1. Foundational Concepts` heading.
---

## PHASE P6: FINAL VERIFICATION (The Quality Gate)
- **Brief Description**: Develop and run a master verification script that programmatically confirms that all remediation actions from P2 through P5 were successful. This script is the final, non-negotiable quality gate.

### P6.1: Develop Master Verification Script
- üé¨ Create a new script file: `tools/validation/verify_audit_remediation_r2.py`.
- üé¨ Implement a check that runs `grep` for obsolete references (verifies P2).
- üé¨ Implement a check that runs `grep` for `change_log_url` (verifies P3).
- üé¨ Implement a check that counts files with `status/draft` (verifies P4).
- üé¨ Implement a check that verifies the content of the `Foundational Concepts` section in `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` is not empty (verifies P5).
- üé¨ The script must exit with a code of 0 for success and 1 for any failure.

### P6.2: Execute Final Verification
- üé¨ Execute `tools/validation/verify_audit_remediation_r2.py`.

---
**üèÅ PROJECT EXIT CONDITIONS**: The R2 Remediation project is 100% complete and verified.
**CONDITION C1**: All phases P1 through P5 are complete.
**CONDITION C2**: The `verify_audit_remediation_r2.py` script is created and executes successfully, exiting with code 0.
