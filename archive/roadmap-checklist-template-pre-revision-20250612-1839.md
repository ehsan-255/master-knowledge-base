# PROJECT EXECUTION ROADMAP CHECKLIST TEMPLATE

>**THIS TEMPLATE IS TO BE GENERATED FROM AN EXISTING PROJECT EXECUTION ROADMAP TO CREATE A SEPARATE PROGRESS CHECKLIST FILE**

>**TO POPULATE THE *1. TEMPLATE*, FOLLOW THE *2. TEMPLATE-POPULATION GUIDELINES* BELOW**

>**THIS CHECKLIST IS USED FOR OPTION B: SEPARATE PROGRESS CHECKLIST (for longer roadmaps) MENTIONED IN THE ROADMAP TEMPLATE**

## **2. TEMPLATE-POPULATION GUIDELINES**

>**BELOW ARE THE GUIDELINES TO POPULATE THE "1. TEMPLATE"**

### **📂 CHECKLIST NAMING CONVENTION**

**FILE NAME FORMAT**: `[job-description]-roadmap-checklist.md`
- **Use same 1-2 words** from the corresponding roadmap filename
- **Examples**: `database-migration-roadmap-checklist.md`, `api-redesign-roadmap-checklist.md`, `user-auth-roadmap-checklist.md`
- **Always end with** `-roadmap-checklist.md`

---

### **🎯 CHECKLIST GENERATION STRATEGY**

>**THE CHECKLIST IS GENERATED BY EXTRACTING THE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE FROM AN EXISTING ROADMAP AND CONVERTING IT TO A STATUS TRACKING FORMAT**

---

#### **🔍 EXTRACTION PROCESS**

##### **REQUIRED ELEMENTS TO EXTRACT**
- **Project title** and brief overview
- **All hierarchy levels** present in the roadmap (Phase/Step/Task/Subtask/Action)
- **Exit conditions** titles and concise criteria
- **Numbering scheme** (P.S.T.U.A format)

##### **ELEMENTS TO EXCLUDE**
- **Detailed descriptions** (Purpose, Scope, and Outcome)
- **Actionable instructions** (🎬 content)
- **Implementation details**
- **Conditional logic statements**

##### **ELEMENTS TO ADD**
- **Status checkboxes** (⬜) for each item
- **One-liner note placeholders** (*Note: [🔤]*) for each item
- **Very concise summaries** of exit conditions instead of full criteria

---

#### **🏗️ STRUCTURE ADAPTATION**

##### **HIERARCHY MATCHING**
- **Mirror exact structure** of the source roadmap
- **Maintain numbering** (P=0, S=1, T=1, U=1, A=1)
- **Include only levels** present in the source roadmap
- **Preserve sequence** and dependencies

##### **CONDENSED FORMAT**
- **Single line titles** instead of full descriptions
- **Very concise exit criteria** instead of detailed conditions
- **Consistent checkbox placement** for all trackable items
- **Uniform note placeholders** for important execution updates only

---

### **👍🏼 BEST PRACTICES**

- **Generate from completed roadmap** - don't create standalone
- **Match decomposition level** of source roadmap exactly
- **Use consistent formatting** for all hierarchy levels
- **Ensure every trackable item** has checkbox and note placeholder
- **Maintain parent-child relationships** clearly
- **Keep titles concise** but descriptive enough for identification

---

### **📋 CHECKLIST-SPECIFIC TEXT BLOCKS**

>**BELOW ARE THE TEXT BLOCKS REQUIRED FOR EACH CHECKLIST DURING THE EXECUTION STAGE. THEY ARE INSTRUCTIONS WHICH ARE NEEDED TO BE FOLLOWED DURING THE EXECUTION STAGE. ADD THEM TO THE END OF EVERY POPULATED CHECKLIST**

**ADD THIS SECTION (which is delimited by '```') TO THE END OF EVERY POPULATED CHECKLIST (without '```')**

```

---

## STATUS LEGEND

⬜ **NOT STARTED**
🔄 **IN PROGRESS**
✅ **COMPLETED**
❌ **BLOCKED**
*Note: [🔤]* **ONE-LINER NOTE PLACEHOLDER: REPLACE 🔤 WITH A ONE-LINER NOTE *ONLY IF NEEDED*, OTHERWISE DELETE THE WHOLE PLACEHOLDER**

**NOTE:** ***🔄 IN PROGRESS and ❌ BLOCKED statuses must be applied to all the affected parent branches all the way up to the project level***

---

## CHECKLIST USAGE PROTOCOL

### **STATUS TRACKING**
- **Update checkboxes** continuously during execution **at all times**
- **Add one-liner notes** *only* for important execution points, decisions, or issues. *NOT REQUIRED; ADD ONLY IF NEEDED*
- **Apply cascading status** to parent branches when items are blocked or in progress
- **Reference main roadmap** for detailed instructions and context

### **NOTE MANAGEMENT**
- **NOTES ARE NOT REQUIRED; ADD ONLY FOR VERY IMPORTANT EXECUTION POINTS, DECISIONS, OR ISSUES**
- **Replace 🔤 with a one-liner note *only if needed*, otherwise delete the whole placeholder**
- **Keep notes brief** - maximum 1-2 lines per item
- **Focus on execution highlights** - important decisions, issues, changes, outcomes
- **Use timestamps** when helpful for critical notes
- **Avoid duplicating** information already in progress tracker

### **COORDINATION**
- **This checklist** is for quick status updates and brief notes
- **Progress tracker** is for detailed completion documentation
- **Main roadmap** remains the authoritative source for execution instructions

>**NO OTHER REPORTING, TRACKING, OR DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED FOR A ROADMAP**
