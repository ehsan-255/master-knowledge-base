>**UPDATE THE CHECKLIST CONTINUOUSLY AT ALL TIMES WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION**

‚¨ú ## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Implement the critical functional gaps and high-priority refinements identified in the Scribe v1.0.1 technical audit. The primary outcome is a fully functional, secure, and observable engine that aligns completely with its architectural blueprint and HMA specifications.

---

‚¨ú ## PHASE 1: Core Functional Integration & Logic Implementation
- Brief Description: This phase addresses the most critical gap: the lack of processing logic in the `Worker` thread. The goal is to connect all core components to create a fully operational event processing pipeline.

---

‚¨ú **üèÅ PHASE 1 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
‚¨ú **CONDITION 1**: The Scribe engine can successfully process a file system event from detection through rule matching, action dispatching, and final file modification using the `atomic_write` utility.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO CONDITION 2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]
‚¨ú **CONDITION 2**: A new end-to-end integration test successfully validates the entire processing pipeline.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO PHASE 2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]

---

‚¨ú ### STEP 1.1: Integrate Core Components into Worker Thread
- Brief Description: Refactor the `Worker` class to instantiate and orchestrate all necessary core services, transforming it from a placeholder into the engine's central processing hub.

---

‚¨ú **üèÅ STEP 1.1 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
‚¨ú **CONDITION 1**: The `Worker` class correctly initializes `ConfigManager`, `PluginLoader`, `SecurityManager`, `RuleProcessor`, and `ActionDispatcher`.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO CONDITION 2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]
‚¨ú **CONDITION 2**: The `_process_event` method implements the full logic chain from reading a file to dispatching actions.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO STEP 1.2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]

---

‚¨ú #### TASK 1.1.1: Instantiate Core Services in Worker
- Brief Description: Modify the `Worker`'s `__init__` method to create and hold instances of all core service components.

‚¨ú ##### SUBTASK 1.1.1.1: Modify `Worker.__init__`
- üé¨ Modify the `__init__` method in `scribe/worker.py` to accept no arguments and instead instantiate `ConfigManager`, `PluginLoader`, `SecurityManager`, `RuleProcessor`, and `ActionDispatcher`. Store these as instance attributes (e.g., `self.config_manager`, `self.plugin_loader`, etc.).

---

‚¨ú #### TASK 1.1.2: Implement Event Processing Logic in `_process_event`
- Brief Description: Replace the placeholder logic in the `_process_event` method with the complete, orchestrated workflow for handling a file event.

‚¨ú ##### SUBTASK 1.1.2.1: Read File Content
- üé¨ In `scribe/worker.py`, within `_process_event`, add logic to safely open and read the full content of the file specified by `event['file_path']`. Wrap this in a `try...except` block to handle potential `IOError`.

‚¨ú ##### SUBTASK 1.1.2.2: Find Rule Matches
- üé¨ Using the `self.rule_processor` instance, call `process_file()` with the file path and content to get a list of `RuleMatch` objects.

‚¨ú ##### SUBTASK 1.1.2.3: Dispatch Actions for Each Match
- üé¨ Loop through the list of `RuleMatch` objects. For each match, call `self.action_dispatcher.dispatch_actions()`. Keep track of the final, potentially modified, file content.

‚¨ú ##### SUBTASK 1.1.2.4: Atomically Write Modified Content
- üé¨ After the loop, check if the final file content has changed from the original. If it has, use the `atomic_write` function from `scribe/core/atomic_write.py` to save the new content back to the original file path.

---

‚¨ú ### STEP 1.2: Create Verification Test for End-to-End Flow
- Brief Description: Develop a new integration test that verifies the successful implementation of the entire Phase 1 workflow.

---

‚¨ú **üèÅ STEP 1.2 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
‚¨ú **CONDITION 1**: A new test file exists in `test-environment/scribe-tests/` that simulates a file change, triggering a pre-configured rule.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO CONDITION 2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]
‚¨ú **CONDITION 2**: The test asserts that the action was executed and the target file's content was correctly modified.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO PHASE 1 EXIT CONDITIONS; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]

---

‚¨ú #### TASK 1.2.1: Develop New Integration Test
- üé¨ Create a new test file `test-environment/scribe-tests/test_full_pipeline.py`. This test will programmatically create a test file, start the Scribe engine, modify the test file to trigger a rule, wait for processing, and then assert that the file was correctly updated by the corresponding action.

---

‚¨ú ## PHASE 2: Security, API, and Observability Refinements
- Brief Description: This phase addresses the high and medium-priority recommendations from the audit, focusing on enhancing security features, improving API contracts, and enriching observability data.

---

‚¨ú **üèÅ PHASE 2 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
‚¨ú **CONDITION 1**: The `run_command` action correctly uses the `allowed_env_vars` parameter, and this is verified by a test.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO CONDITION 2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]
‚¨ú **CONDITION 2**: The `/health` endpoint exposes detailed statistics from the `ActionDispatcher` and `CircuitBreakerManager`.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO PROJECT EXIT CONDITIONS; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]

---

‚¨ú ### STEP 2.1: Implement `allowed_env_vars` Security Feature
- Brief Description: Align the `SecurityManager` and `RunCommandAction` with the blueprint specification for securely passing environment variables.

---

‚¨ú **üèÅ STEP 2.1 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
‚¨ú **CONDITION 1**: `SecurityManager.execute_command_safely` is updated to correctly handle the `allowed_env_vars` parameter.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO CONDITION 2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]
‚¨ú **CONDITION 2**: `RunCommandAction` correctly passes this parameter from its configuration.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO STEP 2.2; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]

---

‚¨ú #### TASK 2.1.1: Update `SecurityManager`
- Brief Description: Modify the `SecurityManager` to support selective environment variable pass-through.

‚¨ú ##### SUBTASK 2.1.1.1: Modify `execute_command_safely`
- üé¨ In `scribe/core/security_manager.py`, modify the signature of `execute_command_safely` to accept an optional `allowed_env_vars: List[str] = None` parameter.

‚¨ú ##### SUBTASK 2.1.1.2: Update `scrub_environment`
- üé¨ In `scribe/core/security_manager.py`, modify `scrub_environment` to accept the `allowed_env_vars` list. If the list is provided, the function should iterate through it and copy the specified variables from `os.environ` into the new "safe" environment dictionary.

---

‚¨ú #### TASK 2.1.2: Update `RunCommandAction` Plugin
- Brief Description: Connect the action's configuration to the new `SecurityManager` functionality.

‚¨ú ##### SUBTASK 2.1.2.1: Pass `allowed_env_vars` Parameter
- üé¨ In `scribe/actions/run_command_action.py`, within the `execute` method, retrieve the `allowed_env_vars` list from the `params` dictionary and pass it to the `self.security_manager.execute_command_safely` call.

---

‚¨ú ### STEP 2.2: Enhance Health Endpoint
- Brief Description: Expose the detailed statistics collected by core components through the `/health` monitoring endpoint.

---

‚¨ú **üèÅ STEP 2.2 EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
‚¨ú **CONDITION 1**: The JSON response from the `/health` endpoint contains new top-level keys for `action_dispatcher_stats` and `circuit_breaker_stats`.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO PHASE 2 EXIT CONDITIONS; ELSE: GOTO ONE LEVEL UP]

---

‚¨ú #### TASK 2.2.1: Expose New Metrics in `ScribeEngine`
- Brief Description: Modify the engine's main status provider function to aggregate and include the new statistical data.

‚¨ú ##### SUBTASK 2.2.1.1: Update `get_status` Method
- üé¨ In `scribe/engine.py`, modify the `get_status` method. After the `Worker` is initialized, it will have instances of the `ActionDispatcher` and `CircuitBreakerManager`. Call the `get_execution_stats()` and `get_circuit_breaker_stats()` methods on these instances and add their output to the main `status` dictionary.

---

‚¨ú **üèÅ PROJECT EXIT CONDITIONS**: (C=1)
‚¨ú **CONDITION 1**: All tasks in Phase 1 and Phase 2 are complete and their exit conditions are met.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO CONDITION 2; ELSE: GOTO TOP]
‚¨ú **CONDITION 2**: The Scribe engine is fully functional, secure according to its blueprint, and observable. All new functionality is covered by tests.
- [IF CONDITIONS = TRUE: GOTO CONDITION 3; ELSE: GOTO TOP]
‚¨ú **CONDITION 3**: The project's `README.md` is updated to reflect the new features and capabilities.
