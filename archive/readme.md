# Repository Archive

This directory contains historical, superseded, or temporary working files related to the Master Knowledge Base project that are no longer in active use but are retained for reference.

## Structure

Files are typically organized into subdirectories named with a `20250531` date suffix indicating when the contents were archived. Common subdirectories include:

* project-notes-and-progress-20250531/: Historical progress reports, commit message drafts, and detailed working notes.
* old-reports-20250531/: Point-in-time reports, such as linter outputs.
* temp-working-files-20250531/: Miscellaneous temporary files from previous work.
* misplaced-files-20250531/: Files that were found in incorrect locations and subsequently archived.
* (Other categories like outdated-roadmaps-and-designs-20250531/ or legacy-root-content-20250531/ may appear here as per project lifecycle phases.)

## Filename Convention for Archived Files

Archived files are typically renamed to archived-original-descriptive-name-20250531.ext to clearly mark their status and retain context.

## Link Integrity

Links within archived documents may be broken as they point to files that might have been moved, renamed, or are also archived. These links are **not** maintained. Automated link checking tools should be configured to ignore paths within this archive/ directory.
