# AOS v4.0 Conceptual Remediation Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0
**Objective:** To systematically remediate all identified architectural and conceptual gaps in the AOS v4.0 documentation, ensuring it fully aligns with the Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) v1.3 and the requirements outlined in `aos-upgrade.md`. This roadmap focuses exclusively on maturing the conceptual framework within the `aos/` folder before any code implementation.

---

## Phase 1: Foundational HMA Architectural Refactoring

**Goal:** To replace the outdated monolithic architecture with a conceptually sound HMA v1.3 model. This phase is the highest priority and is a prerequisite for all subsequent phases.

*   **Task 1.1: Purge Obsolete Architectural Concepts**
    *   **Action:** Delete the file `aos/01-three-layer-architecture.md`.
    *   **Rationale:** This file describes the deprecated three-layer model (Strategic, Orchestration, Execution) which is being replaced by HMA. Its presence creates architectural ambiguity.
    *   **Dependencies:** None.

*   **Task 1.2: Rewrite Core Implementation Architecture Document**
    *   **Action:** Perform a complete rewrite of the `aos/05-implementation-architecture.md` file.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Delete the entire Python class definition for `AdaptiveIntelligenceOrchestrator`.
        2.  Delete the BPMN and DMN XML snippets that reference the old model.
        3.  Delete the outdated `framework_configuration` YAML snippet.
        4.  Create a new primary heading: "**AOS v4.0 Implementation Architecture: An HMA v1.3 Realization**".
        5.  Under this heading, add a section that explicitly describes the adoption of the HMA L0-L4 layered model, referencing `HMA v1.3/HMA v1.3 - Part 2 - High-Level Structure.md` as the normative source.
        6.  Create a new section: "**AOS Capabilities as HMA Plugins**". Describe conceptually how specific AOS tools (Wardley Mapping, TOC, TRIZ) are realized as L3 Capability Plugins and how the 5D Journey is managed by one or more L2 Orchestrator Plugins.
        7.  Create a new section: "**Core Interaction Patterns**". Briefly describe the three primary HMA interaction patterns (Direct Synchronous, Asynchronous Event-Driven, Orchestrated Multi-Plugin) with examples specific to AOS.
        8.  Add a new subsection titled "**Conceptual Configuration**" and insert a new YAML snippet that reflects an HMA structure (e.g., lists of active plugins, event bus configuration).
    *   **Rationale:** This task is the cornerstone of the remediation, directly addressing the primary discrepancy of the monolithic architecture. It resolves Critiques #38, #10, #41, and #1.
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 1.1.

*   **Task 1.3: Update Introduction**
    *   **Action:** Modify `aos/00-introduction.md`.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Search for any mention of the "three-layer architecture".
        2.  Replace these mentions with a description of the new HMA v1.3-based architecture, emphasizing the move to a more resilient, modular, and plugin-based system.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures the introductory document is consistent with the new architectural foundation.
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 1.2.

## Phase 2: Systematic Remediation of `aos-upgrade.md` Gaps

**Goal:** To create or modify documents within the `aos/` folder to explicitly address each of the 50 critique points from `aos-upgrade.md`, ensuring the AOS v4.0 methodology is conceptually complete.

*   **Task 2.1: Address Critique #14 (MECE Decomposability)**
    *   **Action:** Create a new file named `aos/decomposition-and-coupling-policy.md`.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Document the new policy for decomposition, replacing the rigid MECE validation.
        2.  Explain the concept of a `decoupling_score` (0.0 to 1.0) and a `coupling_analysis` object.
        3.  State that the goal is to achieve "Sufficiently Decoupled" components, not perfect MECE.
        4.  Reference this new policy file in `aos/05-implementation-architecture.md`.
    *   **Rationale:** Implements the specific engineered solution for the identified flaw.
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 1.2.

*   **Task 2.2: Address Critique #12 (Antifragile Optionality)**
    *   **Action:** Create a new file named `aos/option-stub-policy.md`.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Define the concept of "Lightweight PDP Stubs" or "Option Stubs".
        2.  Explain that these stubs act as low-cost placeholders for strategic options.
        3.  Clarify that a full PDP is instantiated only when an option is formally activated.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides a home for the specific policy that resolves the critique about the high overhead of maintaining options.
    *   **Dependencies:** None.

*   **Task 2.3: Address Critique #13 & #36 (Human-AI Interaction)**
    *   **Action:** Create a new file named `aos/human-ai-dissent-protocol.md`.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Formally document the "Structured Dissent Protocol" for challenging AI recommendations.
        2.  Formally document the "Gut Feel Override" mechanism.
        3.  Detail the process for logging human rationale to be used for model retraining.
        4.  Add a section on mandatory human-led exercises to prevent skill atrophy.
    *   **Rationale:** Consolidates all policies related to human-AI synergy and conflict resolution into a single, clear document.
    *   **Dependencies:** None.

*   **Task 2.4: Address Critique #17 (AI/Automation Perfection)**
    *   **Action:** Create a new file named `aos/citable-ai-charter.md`.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Mandate the "Citable AI" principle.
        2.  Specify that every AI-generated artifact must include `source_attribution` metadata linking back to the source data.
        3.  Define the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) validation process, requiring a digital sign-off from a human expert for critical AI outputs.
    *   **Rationale:** Establishes the core policy for treating AI outputs with professional skepticism and ensuring traceability.
    *   **Dependencies:** None.

*   **Task 2.5: Address Critique #20 (Beneficial Volatility)**
    *   **Action:** Create a new file named `aos/volatility-playbook.md`.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Document the "Volatility Classification System" (Beneficial, Neutral, Harmful).
        2.  Outline the "Harm Mitigation and Recovery Protocols" for purely negative events.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides the necessary nuance to the framework's handling of volatility, acknowledging that not all disorder is beneficial.
    *   **Dependencies:** None.

*   **Task 2.6: Address Critique #6 & #45 (Hasty Generalization & Homogenization)**
    *   **Action:** Create a new file named `aos/experiment-registry-concept.md`.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Describe the concept of the Experiment Registry for tracking hypotheses.
        2.  Define the `validation_status` for patterns: `[Hypothesized, Tested, Validated, Deprecated]`.
        3.  Explain the "exploration bonus" (e.g., Ïµ-greedy) policy for the recommendation engine to ensure novel patterns are tested.
    *   **Rationale:** Injects scientific discipline and an innovation pipeline into the framework's core logic.
    *   **Dependencies:** None.

*   **Task 2.7 ... 2.N: Address Remaining Critiques**
    *   **Action:** For each remaining critique point in `aos-upgrade.md` (from 1 to 50) not covered above, perform the following:
        1.  **Analyze:** Determine if the solution requires a new policy document or a modification to an existing document (like `aos/02-pdp-digital-twin.md` or `aos/04-knowledge-graph-ecosystem.md`).
        2.  **Execute:** Create a new, specific sub-task (e.g., "Task 2.7: Address Critique #2...") with instructions to either create a new `.md` file with the conceptual solution or to modify an existing one with the required changes. Ensure every single critique point has a corresponding, actionable task.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures every single identified gap is systematically and explicitly closed at the conceptual level.
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 1.2.

## Phase 3: Final Consolidation and Review

**Goal:** To ensure the newly remediated AOS v4.0 conceptual documentation is coherent, consistent, and complete.

*   **Task 3.1: Master Document Review**
    *   **Action:** Read through all files in the `aos/` directory.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Verify that the narrative is consistent throughout all documents.
        2.  Check for and fix any broken internal markdown links.
        3.  Ensure a consistent tone and terminology is used across the entire folder.
    *   **Rationale:** A final quality assurance pass to guarantee the integrity of the completed conceptual framework.
    *   **Dependencies:** All Phase 1 and Phase 2 Tasks.

*   **Task 3.2: Update Appendix**
    *   **Action:** Modify `aos/appendix-c-references.md`.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Add entries linking to the new conceptual documents created in Phase 2 (e.g., `volatility-playbook.md`, `citable-ai-charter.md`).
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures the new artifacts are properly indexed and discoverable.
    *   **Dependencies:** All Phase 2 Tasks.
