# Human-AI Dissent and Synergy Protocol

**Version:** 1.0
**Applies to:** AOS v4.0

---

## 1. Guiding Principle: AI as Assistant, Human as Authority

While AOS v4.0 leverages AI for analysis and orchestration, it operates on the core principle that human judgment, creativity, and ethical oversight are irreplaceable. The AI is a powerful assistant, but the human is the final authority.

This document formalizes the protocols for managing the interaction between humans and the AI, ensuring that human expertise is preserved and that AI recommendations are treated with professional skepticism. It directly addresses Critiques #13 (Human Input vs. AI Automation) and #36 (Over-reliance on AI and Skill Atrophy).

## 2. The Structured Dissent Protocol

Any human participant has the right to formally challenge any AI-generated recommendation, analysis, or decision.

*   **Initiation:** A user initiates a "Dissent" action against a specific AI artifact.
*   **Requirement:** The dissenter must provide a rationale and, where possible, supporting evidence for their objection.
*   **System Action:**
    1.  The dissent is formally logged and linked to the AI artifact in the Knowledge Graph.
    2.  The AI's proposed action is halted pending review.
    3.  A notification is sent to the designated human authority for that domain (e.g., System Architect, Project Sponsor).
    4.  The dissenting argument is used as a high-priority input for future AI model retraining.

## 3. The "Gut Feel" Override

This protocol acknowledges that expert intuition is a valid, valuable form of data that may not yet be quantifiable.

*   **Initiation:** A human expert can flag any AI artifact with a `IntuitiveDissonanceFlag`.
*   **Requirement:** The user provides a brief, plain-language rationale for their "gut feel" (e.g., "This proposed architecture feels too brittle," "I suspect this constraint analysis is missing a political factor").
*   **System Action:**
    1.  The flag immediately lowers the confidence score of the AI artifact.
    2.  If the confidence score drops below a critical threshold, the artifact requires a mandatory secondary review by another designated human expert.
    3.  The rationale is captured and tagged as `intuitive_feedback` in the Knowledge Graph, creating a repository of expert intuition that can be analyzed for patterns over time.

## 4. Preventing Skill Atrophy

To ensure human strategic capabilities are maintained and enhanced, AOS v4.0 mandates the following:

*   **Periodic Human-Led Exercises:** The execution roadmap for any major project must include periodic "AI-off" exercises where a specific strategic challenge (e.g., re-evaluating the primary constraint) must be performed entirely by the human team.
*   **Tracking Human Overrides:** The system will track and analyze the frequency and nature of human overrides and dissents. A high frequency of overrides in a specific domain is not seen as a failure, but as an indicator of where human expertise provides the most value, guiding future improvements in the Human-AI partnership.
