# The Citable AI Charter

**Version:** 1.0
**Applies to:** AOS v4.0

---

## 1. Principle: Treating AI Outputs with Professional Skepticism

AOS v4.0 rejects the assumption of AI perfection. All AI-generated artifacts (analyses, recommendations, code, documentation) must be treated with the same professional skepticism as a junior team member's first draft. They are proposals to be validated, not truths to be accepted.

This charter establishes the core policies for ensuring AI-generated content is traceable, verifiable, and accountable, directly addressing Critique #17 (Assumption of AI/Automation Perfection).

## 2. Mandate: Citable AI

Every piece of data, analysis, or artifact generated by an AI agent **MUST** be citable.

*   **Implementation:** Every AI-generated object in the Knowledge Graph must include a `source_attribution` metadata field.
*   **Content:** This field must contain an array of links back to the specific, versioned source nodes (e.g., PDPs, telemetry data, external documents) that the AI used to derive its output.
*   **Purpose:** This enables any human reviewer to instantly trace an AI's assertion back to its sources, allowing them to verify the reasoning and check for hallucinations or misinterpretations.

## 3. Mandate: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Validation

No critical, AI-generated artifact is considered valid or can be acted upon until it has been explicitly validated by a qualified human expert.

*   **Implementation:** Critical PDP sections (e.g., `solution_architecture`, `strategic_context`) will include a `human_validation` object.
*   **Process:**
    1.  When the AI completes a draft of a critical section, its status is set to `pending_review`.
    2.  A notification is routed to a designated human expert for that domain.
    3.  The expert reviews the artifact and its `source_attribution` links.
    4.  Upon approval, the expert provides a digital sign-off (e.g., updating the `human_validation` object with their identity and a timestamp), changing the status to `validated`.
*   **Enforcement:** The AOS Orchestrator is forbidden from executing plans based on sections that remain in the `pending_review` status.
