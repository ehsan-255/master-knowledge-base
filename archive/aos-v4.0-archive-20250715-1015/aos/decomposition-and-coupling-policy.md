# Decomposition and Coupling Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Applies to:** AOS v4.0

## 1. Replacing MECE with "Sufficiently Decoupled"

In AOS v4.0, the rigid validation for Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) decomposition is replaced with a more pragmatic, heuristic-based approach. The new goal is to produce components that are **"Sufficiently Decoupled"** for independent execution, acknowledging that perfect MECE is often impossible or impractical in complex systems.

This change directly addresses Critique #14 (Assumption of MECE Decomposability) from the `aos-upgrade.md` remediation plan, preventing the system from stalling in infinite validation loops.

## 2. The Decoupling Score

The binary `mece_validated` flag is replaced by a continuous `decoupling_score`, a floating-point value between 0.0 (highly coupled) and 1.0 (perfectly decoupled).

*   The score is calculated by an analysis engine that assesses factors such as shared dependencies, data contracts, and conceptual overlap.
*   A configurable threshold (e.g., `> 0.85`) is used to determine if a decomposition is acceptable for automated processing.

## 3. The Coupling Analysis Object

Alongside the score, the decomposition process now generates a `coupling_analysis` object. This object explicitly documents any identified overlaps, shared dependencies, or potential conflicts between the decomposed components.

This artifact is presented to a human reviewer (e.g., a System Architect) during a `Refine Decomposition` task if the `decoupling_score` falls below the required threshold, allowing for an informed decision on whether the identified coupling is acceptable.

## 4. Alternative Decomposition Strategies

When the standard decomposition algorithm fails to produce a sufficiently decoupled result, the system can now employ alternative strategies, such as:

*   **Overlapping Decomposition:** Allowing components to share certain responsibilities, with the overlap explicitly managed and documented.
*   **Hierarchical Decomposition:** Breaking down a problem into a primary component with attached cross-cutting concerns (e.g., security, logging) that are managed separately.
*   **Network-Based Decomposition:** For highly interconnected systems, modeling the components as nodes in a graph with defined relationships, rather than a strict hierarchy.
