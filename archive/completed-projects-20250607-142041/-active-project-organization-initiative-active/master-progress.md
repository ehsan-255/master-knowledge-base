## YYYY-MM-DD - Standards Definition & README Enhancements

- **Summary:** Significant updates made to `active-project/README.md` to refine and document project organization standards.
- **Details:**
    - Clarified and simplified the visual tree structure diagram within `active-project/README.md`.
    - Relocated "External Dependencies and Notes" to a dedicated section in `active-project/README.md` for better readability.
    - Revised status rules in `active-project/README.md`: introduced a general `-blocked` status, replacing more specific `blocked-by-x` variants.
    - Added a new "Branch Naming Convention" section to `active-project/README.md`.
    - Updated the project folder naming convention in `active-project/README.md` to `-[project-name]-initiative-[status]/` and renamed existing initiative folders (`-refactoring-initiative-active`, `-active-project-organization-initiative-active`) accordingly. All related file paths and references updated.
- **Impact:** These changes further solidify the operational guidelines for managing active projects.
