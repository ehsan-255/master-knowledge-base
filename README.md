# Master Knowledge Base

Welcome to the Master Knowledge Base (MKB)!

This repository serves as a central hub for various Knowledge Bases (KBs). It enforces strict standards for structure, formatting,style, and more. It also incorporates automation capabilities to ensure adherence to these standards and to facilitate other operational aspects.

## Foundational Development Phase

The MKB is currently undergoing foundational development. Key resources and standards are being established.

**Important Locations:**

*   **`master-knowledge-base/`**: This directory is a **temporary staging area** for the core MKB components during this foundational phase. It contains the most recent standards, scripts, and templates that will eventually form the heart of the MKB. Once the foundational work is complete, the contents of this directory will be moved to the root level of this repository.
*   **`active-project/`**: This directory is where ongoing project work is managed. If you are looking to understand the practical application of the MKB's principles or contribute to current initiatives, please familiarize yourself with the documents and structure within `active-project/`. It showcases the foundational work in progress.

**Guidance for New Contributors:**

1.  **Familiarize yourself with Foundational Work**: Review the documents and organizational structure within the `active-project/` directory. This will provide context on how projects are managed and how MKB principles are being applied.
2.  **Understand Current Standards**: Explore the `master-knowledge-base/` directory to understand the latest standards, available scripts, and document templates. These are critical for any contributions.

We aim to create a robust and highly organized knowledge ecosystem. Your contributions and adherence to the established standards are appreciated.
