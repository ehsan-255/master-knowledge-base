# Glossary of Standards Terminology

This glossary defines key terms as they are used within the Universal Knowledge Base Standards documents.

## A
-   **Atomic Content:** Content that is self-contained, focused on a single topic or idea, and can be understood with minimal external context, facilitating reuse and modularity.

## F
-   **Frontmatter (YAML):** A block of metadata in YAML format at the beginning of a Markdown document, enclosed by triple hyphens (`---`), used to define properties of the document.

## I
-   **info-type:** A YAML frontmatter key specifying the precise structural or processing classification of a document, using kebab-case values (e.g., `standard-document`, `kb-definition-map`). Critical for automation.

## K
-   **Kebab-case:** A naming convention where words are written in lowercase and separated by hyphens (e.g., `my-file-name`).
-   **Keyref (Key-Based Referencing):** A system using placeholders (e.g., `{{key.productName}}`) in source documents that are replaced with centrally defined values during a rendering process.

## M
-   **Monolith:** A single, large document compiled from multiple smaller source documents, often for ease of distribution or comprehensive review.

## R
-   **Rendered Document:** A version of a knowledge base document that has had all dynamic placeholders (like keyrefs and conditional content) resolved. This is the consumable version.

## S
-   **Schema (Content Schema):** A predefined structure or template that dictates the mandatory and optional sections, headings, and metadata for a specific type of content document.
-   **Source Document:** The primary, editable version of a knowledge base document, which may contain placeholders for dynamic content.

*(This glossary will be expanded as more terms are identified.)*
