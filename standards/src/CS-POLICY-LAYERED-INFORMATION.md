# Policy: Layered Information Presentation and Progressive Disclosure (CS-POLICY-LAYERED-INFORMATION)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy mandates that all content within the knowledge base be structured using principles of layered information presentation and progressive disclosure. This approach ensures that users can access information at the level of detail appropriate to their needs and understanding, from high-level overviews down to specific details.

## 2. Core Principles and Requirements

The core principle is to present information in an "information funnel," where users start with a general understanding and can progressively drill down into more detailed content as needed.

### Rule 2.1: General to Specific Structure (Derived from U-DETAIL-LEVEL-001, Rule 1.1)
Content MUST be structured to allow users to gain an understanding from a high-level overview progressively down to specific details.
*   **Guidance:** This is an overarching principle that applies to the structure of the entire KB (see [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT]]), individual "Parts" (see [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART]]), and "Chapters" (see [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER]]).

### Rule 2.2: Mandatory Summaries/Abstracts (Derived from U-DETAIL-LEVEL-001, Rule 1.2)
Every major concept, method, "Part," or "Chapter" MUST begin with a concise summary or abstract.
*   **Guidance:**
    *   For "Chapters," this is mandated by [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER]] (Rule 1.2: Topic Abstract).
    *   For specific content types like "Methodology/Technique Descriptions" or "Concept Definitions," this is reinforced by their respective schemas (e.g., [[AS-SCHEMA-METHODOLOGY-DESCRIPTION]], [[AS-SCHEMA-CONCEPT-DEFINITION]]).
    *   This initial summary allows users to quickly grasp the essence of the content and decide if it's relevant to their needs.

### Rule 2.3: Core Ideas Before Details (Derived from U-DETAIL-LEVEL-001, Rule 1.3)
Following a summary or abstract, core principles, main ideas, or key takeaways MUST be presented before detailed elaborations or procedural steps.
*   **Example:** In a document explaining a complex algorithm, outline the algorithm's purpose and main phases before detailing each mathematical step.
*   **Guidance:** This helps users build a foundational understanding before encountering more complex information.

### Rule 2.4: Detailed Information in Deeper Levels (Derived from U-DETAIL-LEVEL-001, Rule 1.4)
Detailed elaborations, such as step-by-step instructions, complex arguments, code snippets, or extensive data, MUST be placed within deeper hierarchical levels of the document (e.g., H3, H4 sections) or, if very extensive, in separate, linked sub-documents or appendices.
*   **Guidance:** Avoid overwhelming users with excessive detail at the higher levels of a document. Use clear headings and subheadings to structure detailed information logically.

### Rule 2.5: Inclusion of Practical Examples (Derived from U-DETAIL-LEVEL-001, Rule 1.5)
Practical examples, application notes, or case studies MUST be included where appropriate to concretize abstract information or illustrate procedures. These should typically follow the theoretical explanations or procedural outlines.
*   **Example:** After explaining a configuration setting, provide an example of its usage.
*   **Guidance:** Examples make information more tangible and easier to understand and apply.

## 3. Benefits of Layered Information Presentation

Adopting this policy provides numerous benefits:

*   **Improved Readability and Scannability:** Users can quickly scan summaries and high-level points to find what they need without being forced to read through exhaustive details.
*   **Enhanced User Comprehension:** Presenting information progressively allows users to build understanding layer by layer, improving comprehension and retention.
*   **Catering to Diverse Expertise Levels:** Novices can focus on overviews and core principles, while experts can quickly navigate to detailed sections.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Users are not overwhelmed with information they may not need, making the content feel more approachable and easier to digest.
*   **Efficient Information Retrieval:** Finding specific details is faster when the overall structure guides the user effectively from general to specific.
*   **Better User Engagement:** Content that is easy to navigate and understand at the desired level of detail is more likely to keep users engaged.

## 4. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all content creation, structuring, and presentation within all Knowledge Bases in the repository. It is a fundamental principle guiding how authors should think about and organize information.

## 5. Cross-References
*   [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT]] - Standard for KB Root Structure.
*   [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART]] - Standard for KB Part Structure.
*   [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER]] - Standard for Chapter Internal Structure (especially regarding abstracts and heading hierarchy).
*   [[AS-SCHEMA-METHODOLOGY-DESCRIPTION]] - Content Schema for "Methodology/Technique Descriptions" (example of a content type that embodies layered information).
*   [[AS-SCHEMA-CONCEPT-DEFINITION]] - Content Schema for "Concept Definitions" (another example).

*This policy (CS-POLICY-LAYERED-INFORMATION) is based on rules 1.1 through 1.5 previously defined in U-DETAIL-LEVEL-001 from COL-ARCH-UNIVERSAL.md.*
