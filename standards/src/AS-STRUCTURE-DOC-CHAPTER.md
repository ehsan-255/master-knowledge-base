# Standard: Content Document (Chapter) Internal Structure (AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER)

This standard defines the mandatory internal structure and content organization for primary content documents, typically referred to as "Chapters." Adherence ensures consistency, readability, semantic structure, and supports automated processing.

## 1. Rules for Chapter Structure

### Rule 1.1: Single H1 Heading (Derived from U-STRUC-002, Rule 2.1)
Every "Chapter" document MUST begin with an H1 heading, which serves as the document title. This MUST be the only H1 heading within the document.
*   **Example:** `# My Chapter Title`
*   **Notes:** This rule is fundamental for semantic structure and document parsing. Adherence to [[SF-SYNTAX-HEADINGS]] is required.

### Rule 1.2: Topic Abstract (Derived from U-STRUC-002, Rule 2.2)
An introductory "Topic Abstract," typically 1-3 paragraphs long, MUST immediately follow the H1 heading.
*   **Content:** The abstract should summarize the document's purpose, scope, and key takeaways.
*   **Notes:** This provides readers with a quick overview before they delve into the details.

### Rule 1.3: Table of Contents (ToC) (Derived from U-STRUC-002, Rule 2.3)
A Table of Contents (ToC) MUST follow the Topic Abstract. This ToC should link to all H2 sections and, where appropriate, significant H3 sections within the document.
*   **Example:**
    ```markdown
    ## Table of Contents
    - [Section 1 Title](#section-1-title)
    - [Section 2 Title](#section-2-title)
      - [Subsection 2.1 Title](#subsection-21-title)
    ```
*   **Notes:**
    *   Manual creation of the ToC or the use of a user's chosen authoring tool/plugin is acceptable. The key is the presence and accuracy of the ToC.
    *   Links MUST use the syntax defined in [[SF-LINKS-INTERNAL-SYNTAX]].

### Rule 1.4: Hierarchical Content Organization (Derived from U-STRUC-002, Rule 2.4)
Content within a "Chapter" document MUST be organized using hierarchical Markdown headings (H2 through H6). Heading levels MUST NOT be skipped.
*   **Example:** An H2 heading may be followed by an H3, but not directly by an H4.
    ```markdown
    ## Section 1 (H2)
    ### Subsection 1.1 (H3)
    #### Detail A (H4)
    ### Subsection 1.2 (H3)
    ## Section 2 (H2)
    ```
*   **Notes:**
    *   The H1 heading is reserved for the document title as per Rule 1.1.
    *   Adherence to the specific Markdown syntax for headings defined in [[SF-SYNTAX-HEADINGS]] is mandatory.

### Rule 1.5: H2 Sections as Major Sub-Topics (Derived from U-STRUC-002, Rule 2.5)
Each H2 section within a "Chapter" document MUST represent a major sub-topic of that chapter.
*   **Guidance:**
    *   H2 sections break down the chapter's primary subject (defined by the H1/title) into its core components or logical divisions.
    *   If an H2 section becomes too long or covers too many distinct ideas, it should be further subdivided using H3 headings, or potentially split into a separate chapter if the sub-topic is substantial enough.

### Rule 1.6: Concluding "Summary" Section (Derived from U-STRUC-002, Rule 2.6)
A concluding section, typically titled "Summary" and formatted as an H2 heading, MUST be included at the end of the main content.
*   **Example:** `## Summary`
*   **Content:** This section should briefly reiterate the main points or key takeaways of the document.

### Rule 1.7: "See Also" Section (Derived from U-STRUC-002, Rule 2.7)
If relevant cross-references exist, a section titled "See Also" and formatted as an H2 heading MUST be included after the "Summary" section.
*   **Example:**
    ```markdown
    ## See Also
    - [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART]]
    - [[EXAMPLE-STANDARD-ID]]
    ```
*   **Content:** This section should contain a list of links to related documents, standards, or sections that provide further context or information.
*   **Notes:** Links MUST use the syntax defined in [[SF-LINKS-INTERNAL-SYNTAX]]. If no relevant cross-references exist, this section may be omitted.

## 2. Rationale and Importance

Adherence to this standard is crucial for:

*   **Readability and Scannability:** A clear and consistent heading hierarchy allows readers to easily scan the document, understand its structure, and locate specific information.
*   **Accessibility:** Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on proper heading structures to provide navigation and context to users with disabilities. Skipping heading levels or using them non-semantically can create significant accessibility barriers.
*   **Semantic Structure and Machine Processing:** Correct heading hierarchy provides a clear semantic structure that can be understood by machines. This is vital for:
    *   Automated generation of accurate Tables of Contents.
    *   Content indexing and search engine optimization.
    *   AI-driven content summarization, analysis, or repurposing.
    *   Automated quality checks and validation.
*   **Authoring Consistency:** Clear rules on heading usage simplify the authoring process and ensure a uniform look and feel across all documents.
*   **Maintainability:** Well-structured documents are easier to understand, update, and maintain over time.

## 3. Illustrative Example

### Partial structure of a Chapter document (e.g., `01-introduction.md`):

```markdown
# Introduction to Research Methodology

This chapter introduces the core concepts of research methodology, outlining its importance and the foundational elements required for conducting systematic investigation. Key takeaways include understanding different research paradigms and the role of ethics in research.

## Table of Contents
- [What is Research?](#what-is-research)
- [Importance of Methodology](#importance-of-methodology)
- [Types of Research](#types-of-research)

## What is Research?
Research is a systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions.
### Defining Research
The definition of research can vary across disciplines...

## Importance of Methodology
A sound methodology is crucial for the validity and reliability of research findings...

## Types of Research
Research can be broadly categorized into qualitative and quantitative approaches...

## Summary
This chapter provided an overview of research methodology, defined key terms, and highlighted the importance of a structured approach to investigation.

*This standard (AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER) consolidates and is based on rules 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 previously defined in U-STRUC-002 from COL-ARCH-UNIVERSAL.md. This version 2.0.0 incorporates content organization requirements previously defined in CS-POLICY-DOC-CHAPTER-CONTENT.*
