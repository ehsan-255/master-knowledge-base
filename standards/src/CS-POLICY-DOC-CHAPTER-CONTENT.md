# Policy: Content Organization and Heading Usage in Chapters (CS-POLICY-DOC-CHAPTER-CONTENT)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy mandates the correct hierarchical use of Markdown headings (H2-H6) for structuring content within "Chapter" documents and requires that each H2 section represents a major sub-topic. This ensures content is organized logically, semantically structured, accessible, and easily processable by automated tools.

## 2. Core Requirements

### Rule 2.1: Hierarchical Markdown Headings (Derived from U-STRUC-002, Rule 2.4)
Content within a "Chapter" document MUST be organized using hierarchical Markdown headings (H2 through H6). Heading levels MUST NOT be skipped.
*   **Example:** An H2 heading may be followed by an H3, but not directly by an H4.
    ```markdown
    ## Section 1 (H2)
    ### Subsection 1.1 (H3)
    #### Detail A (H4)
    ### Subsection 1.2 (H3)
    ## Section 2 (H2)
    ```
*   **Notes:**
    *   The H1 heading is reserved for the document title as per [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER]].
    *   Adherence to the specific Markdown syntax for headings defined in [[SF-SYNTAX-HEADINGS]] is mandatory.

### Rule 2.2: H2 Sections as Major Sub-Topics (Derived from U-STRUC-002, Rule 2.5)
Each H2 section within a "Chapter" document MUST represent a major sub-topic of that chapter.
*   **Guidance:**
    *   H2 sections break down the chapter's primary subject (defined by the H1/title) into its core components or logical divisions.
    *   If an H2 section becomes too long or covers too many distinct ideas, it should be further subdivided using H3 headings, or potentially split into a separate chapter if the sub-topic is substantial enough.

## 3. Rationale and Importance

Adherence to this policy is crucial for:

*   **Readability and Scannability:** A clear and consistent heading hierarchy allows readers to easily scan the document, understand its structure, and locate specific information.
*   **Accessibility:** Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on proper heading structures to provide navigation and context to users with disabilities. Skipping heading levels or using them non-semantically can create significant accessibility barriers.
*   **Semantic Structure and Machine Processing:** Correct heading hierarchy provides a clear semantic structure that can be understood by machines. This is vital for:
    *   Automated generation of accurate Tables of Contents.
    *   Content indexing and search engine optimization.
    *   AI-driven content summarization, analysis, or repurposing.
    *   Automated quality checks and validation.
*   **Authoring Consistency:** Clear rules on heading usage simplify the authoring process and ensure a uniform look and feel across all documents.
*   **Maintainability:** Well-structured documents are easier to understand, update, and maintain over time.

## 4. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all "Chapter" documents (as defined in [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER]]) across all Knowledge Bases.

## 5. Cross-References
- [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER]] - Defines the overall internal structure for Chapter documents.
- [[SF-SYNTAX-HEADINGS]] - Standard for Markdown Heading Syntax.
