# Standard: Mandate for Knowledge Base Usage Guide (GM-MANDATE-KB-USAGE-GUIDE)

## 1. Policy Statement

This standard mandates the creation, maintenance, and core content requirements for a dedicated "Knowledge Base Usage Guide." This guide is essential for user onboarding, promoting effective utilization of the knowledge base (KB) and its standards, and ensuring a common understanding of KB navigation and governance processes.

## 2. Core Requirements for the Knowledge Base Usage Guide

### Rule 2.1: Existence and Identification (Derived from U-ONBOARDING-001, Rule 1.1)
A dedicated guide document, identified by the `standard_id` [[GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE]], MUST exist and be maintained.
*   **Location:** This guide MUST reside in a well-known location, typically within the `/standards/src/` directory or a dedicated guides section. (The exact path will be determined by the final location of `GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE`).
*   **Purpose:** This document serves as the primary onboarding resource and comprehensive usage guide for the entire knowledge base ecosystem, including its standards.

### Rule 2.2: Core Content - Purpose and Navigation (Derived from U-ONBOARDING-001, Rule 1.2)
The [[GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE]] document MUST, at a minimum:
    a.  Clearly explain the overall purpose and value of the knowledge base and its associated standards.
    b.  Provide comprehensive instructions on how to navigate the knowledge base structure, including the use of the master `kb-directory.md`, individual KB `root.md` files, collection documents, and Tables of Contents.
    c.  Explain how to find specific standards, policies, and guidelines.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures users can effectively find and understand the information they need.

### Rule 2.3: Core Content - Governance Processes (Derived from U-ONBOARDING-001, Rule 1.3)
The [[GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE]] document MUST briefly outline the process for:
    a.  Proposing new standards or changes to existing standards.
    b.  Asking for clarifications or interpretations of standards.
*   **Guidance:** This section should link to the detailed governance policy document (expected to be [[OM-POLICY-STANDARDS-GOVERNANCE]]) for complete procedures.
*   **Rationale:** Facilitates community involvement and ensures users understand how to participate in the evolution of standards.

### Rule 2.4: Core Content - Pointers to Key Resources (Derived from U-ONBOARDING-001, Rule 1.4)
The [[GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE]] document SHOULD include pointers (links) to:
    a.  The master Tag Glossary (expected to be [[MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY]]).
    b.  The directory or standard defining available document templates (expected to be [[AS-STRUCTURE-TEMPLATES-DIRECTORY]] or similar).
*   **Rationale:** Helps users leverage essential supporting resources for understanding and creating content.

## 3. Importance of the Usage Guide

The mandated Knowledge Base Usage Guide is critical for:

*   **Effective Onboarding:** Provides a starting point for new users, contributors, and consumers of the knowledge base.
*   **Promoting Standards Adherence:** Helps users understand how to find, interpret, and apply standards correctly.
*   **Ensuring Consistent KB Usage:** Fosters a shared understanding of how to navigate and interact with the KB ecosystem.
*   **Facilitating Contributions:** Clarifies how users can contribute to the improvement and development of standards.
*   **Reducing Support Load:** Proactively answers common questions about KB usage and standards.

## 4. Scope of Application

This standard applies to the governance body responsible for the knowledge base ecosystem, mandating the provision and maintenance of the [[GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE]] document.

## 5. Cross-References
- [[GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE]] - The actual guide document whose existence and core content are mandated by this standard.
- [[OM-POLICY-STANDARDS-GOVERNANCE]] - Detailed governance processes.
- [[MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY]] - The Tag Glossary.
- [[AS-STRUCTURE-TEMPLATES-DIRECTORY]] - Standard defining the templates directory.
- [[AS-STRUCTURE-MASTER-KB-INDEX]] - Relevant for explaining navigation via `kb-directory.md`.

*This standard (GM-MANDATE-KB-USAGE-GUIDE) is based on rules 1.1 through 1.4 previously defined in U-ONBOARDING-001 from COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md, rephrasing them as mandates for the existence and content of the guide.*
