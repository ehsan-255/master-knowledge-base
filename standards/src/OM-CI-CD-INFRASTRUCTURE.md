# Standard: CI/CD Infrastructure and Pipeline Requirements (OM-CI-CD-INFRASTRUCTURE)

## 1. Standard Statement

This standard defines the infrastructure requirements, pipeline configurations, and deployment processes for the Master Knowledge Base CI/CD ecosystem. All CI/CD implementations MUST follow these infrastructure standards to ensure reliable, automated, and quality-controlled deployments.

**INFRASTRUCTURE MANDATE:** All CI/CD pipelines MUST implement proper infrastructure patterns, quality gates, and deployment controls as defined in this standard.

## 2. CI/CD Infrastructure Requirements

### 2.1. Pipeline Architecture

**Required Pipeline Structure:**
- **Pre-commit Stage:** Local validation using existing tool arsenal
- **Build Stage:** Automated validation and quality checking
- **Test Stage:** Comprehensive testing and validation execution
- **Deploy Stage:** Controlled deployment with rollback capabilities

**Integration Requirements:**
- MUST integrate with existing validation tools from `tools/` directory
- MUST support automated execution of validation standards defined in `[[QM-VALIDATION-METADATA]]`
- MUST provide clear failure reporting and remediation guidance

### 2.2. Quality Gates

**Mandatory Quality Gates:**
1. **Validation Gate:** All content MUST pass validation tools before proceeding
2. **Standards Gate:** All content MUST comply with applicable standards
3. **Dependency Gate:** All cross-references and links MUST be validated
4. **Security Gate:** All security requirements MUST be satisfied

**Gate Implementation:**
- Quality gates MUST be automated and non-bypassable without explicit authorization
- Failed gates MUST prevent deployment and trigger appropriate remediation workflows
- Gate results MUST be logged in `tools/reports/` for audit and analysis

## 3. Pipeline Configuration Standards

### 3.1. Pre-commit Hook Configuration

**Required Pre-commit Setup:**
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: kb-linter
        name: Knowledge Base Linter
        entry: python tools/linter/kb_linter.py
        language: python
        files: \.md$
        
      - id: naming-enforcer
        name: Naming Convention Enforcer
        entry: python tools/naming-enforcer/naming_enforcer.py
        language: python
        always_run: true
        
      - id: validation-check
        name: Metadata Validation
        entry: python tools/validation/on_demand_validator.py
        language: python
        files: \.md$
```

### 3.2. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Pipeline Tool Integration:**
- `tools/linter/kb_linter.py` - Comprehensive content validation
- `tools/naming-enforcer/naming_enforcer.py` - Naming convention enforcement
- `tools/validation/on_demand_validator.py` - On-demand validation capabilities
- `tools/validators/graph_validator.py` - Relationship and cross-reference validation
- `tools/validators/validate_registry.py` - JSON-LD registry validation

**Execution Requirements:**
- All tools MUST be executed in CI/CD pipeline with appropriate parameters
- Tool execution MUST follow error classification from `[[QM-VALIDATION-METADATA]]`
- Results MUST be stored in standardized format in `tools/reports/`

## 4. Deployment Controls

### 4.1. Deployment Gates

**Blocking Conditions:**
- Any Critical Error from validation tools blocks deployment
- Failed quality gates prevent deployment progression
- Security violations halt deployment process
- Cross-reference failures block deployment

**Rollback Triggers:**
- Post-deployment validation failures trigger automatic rollback
- System health degradation initiates rollback procedures
- User-reported critical issues may trigger manual rollback

### 4.2. Deployment Monitoring

**Required Monitoring:**
- Real-time deployment status tracking
- Automated health checks post-deployment
- Performance monitoring during deployment
- Error rate monitoring and alerting

**Monitoring Integration:**
- MUST integrate with existing reporting infrastructure in `tools/reports/`
- MUST provide real-time visibility into deployment status
- MUST support automated alerts for deployment issues

## 5. Infrastructure Performance Requirements

### 5.1. Pipeline Performance Standards

**Execution Time Limits:**
- Pre-commit validation: ≤30 seconds
- CI/CD pipeline execution: ≤10 minutes
- Deployment process: ≤5 minutes
- Rollback execution: ≤2 minutes

**Reliability Requirements:**
- Pipeline uptime: ≥99% availability
- Failed execution recovery: ≤5 minutes
- Tool execution consistency: 100% reproducible results
