# Policy: Universal Principles for Content Inclusion (CS-POLICY-SCOPE-INCLUSION)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy outlines the universal principles governing the inclusion of content within any Knowledge Base (KB). Adherence to these principles is essential for maintaining the focus, quality, relevance, and overall utility of the knowledge base, ensuring it remains a valuable and trusted resource.

## 2. Core Principles for Content Inclusion

### Rule 2.1: Relevance to KB Scope (Derived from U-SCOPE-INCLUDE-001, Rule 1.1)
All content included in any Knowledge Base (KB) MUST be directly relevant to the stated scope and purpose of that specific KB.
*   **Guidance:** The scope and purpose of each KB are typically defined in its `root.md` file and its entry in the `kb-directory.md` (see [[AS-STRUCTURE-MASTER-KB-INDEX]]). Content that falls outside this defined scope should not be included in that particular KB, though it may be relevant for a different KB.
*   **Rationale:** This ensures that KBs remain focused and do not become diluted with irrelevant information, making it easier for users to find what they need.

### Rule 2.2: Verifiability and Citability (Derived from U-SCOPE-INCLUDE-001, Rule 1.2)
Content MUST be verifiable or derived from citable sources for KBs that deal with factual information. For KBs focusing on conceptual or philosophical topics, content should be based on logical reasoning and established schools of thought.
*   **Guidance:**
    *   Factual claims, data, and significant assertions should be supported by evidence.
    *   Citations for external sources MUST adhere to [[SF-FORMATTING-CITATIONS]].
*   **Rationale:** Requiring verifiability and proper citation builds trust in the KB's content and allows users to explore source material for deeper understanding or validation.

### Rule 2.3: Focus on Actionable and Evergreen Knowledge (Derived from U-SCOPE-INCLUDE-001, Rule 1.3)
Content MUST primarily focus on providing information and actionable knowledge (e.g., "how-to" guides, explanations of "why" or "what," best practices, standard procedures, definitions).
*   **Exclusions:** Content should generally avoid:
    *   Ephemeral news or time-sensitive announcements (unless the KB is specifically an archive for such items and this is clearly stated in its scope).
    *   Personal opinions that are not protected by a specific, defined "Expert Opinion" or similar template/schema.
    *   Transient discussions or uncurated commentary.
*   **Rationale:** Prioritizing durable, actionable knowledge ensures the long-term value and utility of the KB. This focus helps differentiate the KB from more informal communication channels.

## 3. Importance of These Principles

Upholding these content inclusion principles is vital for:

*   **Maintaining Focus:** Ensures each KB stays true to its defined purpose, preventing scope creep and information overload.
*   **Ensuring Quality and Reliability:** By requiring verifiability and a focus on actionable knowledge, the overall quality and reliability of the KB are enhanced.
*   **Maximizing Utility:** Relevant, focused, and high-quality content makes the KB a more useful and valuable resource for its target audience.
*   **Building User Trust:** Users are more likely to trust and rely on a KB that contains accurate, well-sourced, and relevant information.
*   **Improving Discoverability:** When content is relevant and focused, search and navigation within the KB become more effective.
*   **Streamlining Maintenance:** Clear inclusion criteria simplify content lifecycle management, including reviews, updates, and archiving decisions.

## 4. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all individuals involved in planning, creating, contributing, or curating content for any Knowledge Base within the repository.
