# Standards Knowledge Base Root (AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB)

Welcome to the Standards Knowledge Base (KB). This document serves as the main entry point and master table of contents for all standards as part of a **sophisticated three-layer enterprise architecture**. This document represents the **Presentation Layer** of the architecture, focusing on user navigation and content discovery.

**üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT:**
- **Physical Layer:** `AS-KB-DIRECTORY-STRUCTURE.md` (file system organization)
- **Logical/Semantic Layer:** `AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB.md` (DITA map + ontological structure)
- **Presentation Layer (This Document):** Navigation interface, user experience, content discovery

**üéØ DITA/RDF INSPIRATION:**
- **User Interface Function:** Provides navigation structure following DITA topic-based principles
- **Content Discovery:** Enables users to find and access atomic topic documents
- **Semantic Navigation:** Leverages ontological relationships defined in the logical layer

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** This three-layer separation is **INTENTIONAL SOPHISTICATED DESIGN** inspired by enterprise architecture best practices. Each layer serves a distinct purpose in the overall information architecture.

The purpose of this KB is to ensure consistency, quality, and interoperability across all managed knowledge domains through sophisticated DITA-inspired and RDF/OWL-inspired design patterns. For the conceptual map of how this KB is organized, please refer to `[[AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB]]`.

## Master Table of Contents
