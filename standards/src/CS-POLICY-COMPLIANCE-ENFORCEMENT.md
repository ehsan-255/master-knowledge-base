# Policy: Standards Compliance Enforcement (CS-POLICY-COMPLIANCE-ENFORCEMENT)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy establishes mandatory enforcement mechanisms, consequences, and procedures for ensuring compliance with all Master Knowledge Base standards as governed by `[[OM-POLICY-STANDARDS-GOVERNANCE]]`. Non-compliance with established standards undermines operational integrity, quality assurance, and the reliability of the knowledge base ecosystem.
