# Policy: Standards Governance Framework (OM-POLICY-STANDARDS-GOVERNANCE)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy establishes the comprehensive governance framework for proposing, reviewing, updating, and managing standards within the knowledge base ecosystem. A robust governance process with clear authority structures is essential for maintaining the quality, consistency, relevance, and integrity of all standard documents while ensuring seamless integration with validation tools and enforcement mechanisms.

**GOVERNANCE MANDATE:** All standards within the Master Knowledge Base ecosystem MUST be governed through the structured authority hierarchy, lifecycle processes, and quality assurance mechanisms defined in this policy.

## 2. Core Governance Requirements

### Rule 2.1: Documented Proposal and Change Process (Derived from U-GOVERNANCE-001, Rule 1.1)
A defined and documented process for proposing new standards or initiating changes to existing standards MUST be established and maintained.
*   **Guidance:** This process should be clearly outlined in a readily accessible location, such as the primary "How to Use These Standards" guide (expected to be [[GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE]]) or a dedicated governance document. The process should specify how proposals are submitted (e.g., issue tracker, formal document submission), what information a proposal must contain, and the initial steps for consideration.
*   **Importance:** A documented process ensures transparency and provides a clear pathway for all stakeholders to contribute to the evolution of standards. It prevents ad-hoc changes and promotes systematic development.

### Rule 2.2: Mandatory Review Process (Derived from U-GOVERNANCE-001, Rule 1.2)
All proposed new standards and any proposed substantive changes to existing standards MUST undergo a formal review process before being approved and incorporated into the official set of standards.
*   **Guidance:** The nature of the review process (e.g., peer review, subject matter expert (SME) consultation, editorial board review, public comment period) should be defined as part of the documented governance process (see Rule 2.1). The review should assess the proposal's clarity, necessity, impact, consistency with existing standards, and feasibility.
*   **Importance:** A mandatory review process acts as a quality control mechanism, ensuring that standards are well-vetted, technically sound, and align with the overall goals of the knowledge base before they become official.

### Rule 2.3: Prompt Updates to Registries and Navigational Aids (Derived from U-GOVERNANCE-001, Rule 1.3)
Upon the addition, significant modification, or deprecation of any standard, all relevant registries and navigational aids MUST be updated promptly.
*   **Guidance:** This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   The JSON-LD schema registry (`standards/registry/schema-registry.jsonld`) if tags are added, changed, or deprecated as part of the standard's lifecycle, following the process defined in [[OM-PROCESS-SST-UPDATE]].
    *   Any master Table of Contents documents, such as `kb-directory.md` or collection documents (e.g., `COL-ARCH-UNIVERSAL.md` before its deprecation).
    *   Automated indices or search databases.
*   **Importance:** Keeping registries and navigational aids up-to-date is crucial for maintaining the consistency, discoverability, and usability of the standards ecosystem. Outdated information can lead to confusion and hinder the effective application of standards.

## 3. Governance Authority Structure

### 3.1. Governance Decision Hierarchy

**Primary Governance Authority:** Governance Board
- **Composition:** KB architects, domain experts, and quality assurance leads
- **Authority:** Final approval for new standards, major revisions, and deprecation decisions
- **Meeting Frequency:** Bi-weekly review sessions with emergency sessions as needed

**Secondary Governance Authority:** Standards Committee  
- **Composition:** Technical leads, senior contributors, and domain specialists
- **Authority:** Initial review, technical assessment, and recommendation to Governance Board
- **Responsibility:** Detailed technical review and impact assessment

**Operational Governance Authority:** Quality Assurance Team
- **Composition:** QA leads and validation specialists  
- **Authority:** Process compliance, validation integration, and day-to-day governance operations
- **Integration:** Direct interface with enforcement mechanisms in `[[CS-POLICY-COMPLIANCE-ENFORCEMENT]]`

### 3.2. Authority Integration with Enforcement

**Governance → Enforcement Handoff:**
- Standards approved by Governance Board → Automatically enforced by CS compliance framework
- Governance decisions trigger enforcement rule updates
- Governance authority takes precedence over enforcement authority for standard modifications

**Enforcement → Governance Escalation:**
- Repeated violations → Standards Committee review for potential standard revision
- Exception requests → Governance Board evaluation for policy adjustments
- Appeals process → Joint governance and enforcement authority review

## 4. Comprehensive Standards Lifecycle Management

### 4.1. Standards Creation Process

**Phase 1: Proposal and Initial Review (0-14 days)**
1. **Proposal Submission:** Via issue tracker or formal document submission to Standards Committee
2. **Initial Assessment:** Standards Committee evaluates necessity, scope, and feasibility
3. **Stakeholder Identification:** Identification of affected parties and subject matter experts
4. **Technical Review Assignment:** Assignment to appropriate technical reviewers

**Phase 2: Development and Technical Review (14-45 days)**
1. **Draft Development:** Creation of initial standard draft following established templates
2. **Technical Review:** Detailed technical assessment by assigned experts
3. **Tool Integration Assessment:** Evaluation of integration with existing validation tools (`tools/linter/`, `tools/naming-enforcer/`, etc.)
4. **Cross-Standard Impact Analysis:** Assessment of effects on existing standards and workflows

**Phase 3: Governance Review and Approval (45-60 days)**
1. **Standards Committee Review:** Formal committee evaluation and recommendation
2. **Governance Board Evaluation:** Final review by Governance Board
3. **Approval Decision:** Formal approval or rejection with detailed rationale
4. **Registry Integration:** Update of JSON-LD schema registry via `[[OM-PROCESS-SST-UPDATE]]`

### 4.2. Standards Modification Process

**Minor Modifications (Clarifications, corrections):**

## 10. Rationale for Comprehensive Governance

Enhanced governance provides critical benefits:

*   **Quality Assurance:** Ensures standards are accurate, clear, and fit for purpose through structured review and approval with automated validation support.
*   **Consistency:** Maintains consistency across different standards and prevents conflicting rules through automated cross-reference validation.
*   **Transparency:** Provides visibility into how standards are developed, changed, and managed with comprehensive audit trails.
*   **Stakeholder Buy-in:** Involves stakeholders in structured proposal and review processes with clear authority hierarchies.
*   **Controlled Evolution:** Allows systematic evolution with proper impact assessment and validation integration.
*   **Risk Management:** Reduces risks through comprehensive review processes and automated validation integration.
*   **Tool Integration:** Ensures seamless integration with existing validation and automation infrastructure.
