# Policy: Content Modularity and Use of Transclusion (CS-MODULARITY-TRANSCLUSION-POLICY)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy promotes the design of content for modularity and governs the appropriate use of transclusion (content embedding) as defined in [[SF-TRANSCLUSION-SYNTAX]]. The goal is to foster content reusability, improve maintainability, ensure consistency, and adhere to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.

## 2. Core Policies for Modularity and Transclusion

### Rule 2.1: Atomic and Self-Contained Content (Derived from U-MODULAR-001, Rule 1.1 & 1.3)
Content pertaining to distinct concepts, methodologies, processes, or key steps SHOULD be designed to be as atomic and self-contained as possible.
*   **Guidance:**
    *   Each document or major section should focus on a specific, well-defined topic.
    *   Minimize "context bleeding" from unrelated surrounding topics within the same content chunk. If context from other documents is needed, prefer linking using [[CS-LINKING-INTERNAL-POLICY]] rather than extensive repetition.
    *   This aligns with the principles behind specific content schemas like [[AS-SCHEMA-METHODOLOGY-DESCRIPTION]] and [[AS-SCHEMA-CONCEPT-DEFINITION]], which encourage focused content.
*   **Rationale:** Atomic content is easier to understand in isolation, reuse in different contexts (including via transclusion), and maintain independently.

### Rule 2.2: Use Transclusion to Avoid Duplication (Derived from U-MODULAR-001, Rule 1.2)
Transclusion, using the syntax defined in [[SF-TRANSCLUSION-SYNTAX]], MUST be used instead of duplicating substantial, identical blocks of common content across multiple documents.
*   **Examples of "substantial common content":**
    *   Sets of core principles applicable to multiple methodologies.
    *   Standard disclaimers, warnings, or introductory paragraphs.
    *   Reusable tables or complex list structures.
    *   Key definitions that need to appear in context in multiple places.
*   **Rationale:** Transclusion ensures that common information is sourced from a single place, making updates easier (edit once, updates reflect everywhere) and guaranteeing consistency.

## 3. Guidance on When to Transclude vs. Link

Choosing between transclusion and simple linking requires judgment. Here are some guidelines:

### Rule 3.1: Linking for Contextual Navigation
Use standard internal links (see [[CS-LINKING-INTERNAL-POLICY]]) when:
*   Referring to a related but distinct topic that the user might want to explore for more comprehensive understanding.
*   Pointing to prerequisite knowledge or subsequent steps in a larger workflow.
*   The referenced content is substantial enough to be its own document or major section, and embedding it would disrupt the flow of the current document.
*   **Example:** A document on "Advanced Data Analysis" might link to a document defining "Statistical Significance" rather than transcluding the entire definition.

### Rule 3.2: Transclusion for Seamless Integration of Reusable Content
Use transclusion (see [[SF-TRANSCLUSION-SYNTAX]]) when:
*   A specific, relatively small piece of content (e.g., a definition, a set of principles, a specific instruction set, a warning notice) needs to appear *as if it's part of the current document* for clarity or completeness.
*   The transcluded content is truly identical and intended to be reused verbatim in multiple locations.
*   The flow of the current document benefits from having that piece of information directly embedded, rather than requiring the user to navigate away.
*   **Example:** Transcluding a standard safety warning into multiple procedural documents. Transcluding a shared "Core Principles" section into several related methodology descriptions.

### Rule 3.3: Avoid Overuse of Transclusion
While transclusion is powerful for reuse, overuse can lead to documents that are difficult to read as standalone entities or that obscure the primary narrative of the host document.
*   **Guidance:** Ensure that the host document still has a clear primary purpose and narrative, and that transcluded content serves to support that narrative rather than replace it entirely or make it disjointed.
*   **Consideration:** If a document becomes merely a collection of transcluded blocks, re-evaluate if a different structuring approach (e.g., a well-linked collection document) might be more appropriate.

## 4. Benefits of Modularity and Transclusion

*   **Maintainability (DRY Principle):** Edit information in one place, and changes propagate to all documents where it is transcluded. This significantly reduces the effort and risk of errors associated with updating duplicated content.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures that common information (definitions, principles, warnings) is presented identically wherever it appears.
*   **Reusability:** Allows valuable content components to be reused across different contexts without copy-pasting.
*   **Authoring Efficiency:** Authors can assemble new documents more quickly by reusing existing modular content blocks.
*   **Reduced Redundancy:** Minimizes content duplication, making the knowledge base more concise and efficient.

## 5. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all content creators and editors within the knowledge base. It guides decisions on how to structure content for reusability and when to employ transclusion.

*This policy (CS-MODULARITY-TRANSCLUSION-POLICY) is based on rules 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 previously defined in U-MODULAR-001 (now deprecated and superseded by this policy), and provides guidance on applying the syntax defined in [[SF-TRANSCLUSION-SYNTAX]].*
