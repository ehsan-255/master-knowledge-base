# Guideline Conflict and Ambiguity Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a thorough investigation into the governing documents of the `active-project/` workflow. The analysis was initiated to determine the root cause of a previously identified discrepancy in project documentation.

The investigation confirms that the initial issue was caused by a direct **contradiction between a high-level guideline and a specific, low-level template**. Furthermore, the investigation has uncovered **four additional major conflicts and ambiguities** within the project management standards.

These issues create a significant risk of future errors, inconsistent project execution, and non-compliance. This report details each finding, analyzes the potential negative impact, and provides concrete recommendations for remediation to establish a true Single Source of Truth (SST) for project management protocol.

## 2. Root Cause of the Initial Issue

### Finding 1: Contradictory Sub-Task Documentation Requirements

*   **The Issue:** The system has two conflicting mandatory instructions regarding the documentation required for an active sub-task.
    *   **`active-project/README.md` (Section 2.A.4) states:** An active sub-folder **MUST RECEIVE** its own `analysis-report`, `roadmap`, and `progress` files.
    *   **`active-project/roadmap-template.md` (Section `ðŸš¦ COORDINATION`) states:** "**NO OTHER REPORTING, TRACKING, OR DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED FOR A ROADMAP**" besides the roadmap itself, a checklist, and a progress tracker.
*   **Root Cause:** The high-level guideline (`README.md`) mandates a sub-task analysis report, while the specific implementation template (`roadmap-template.md`) explicitly forbids it. This is a classic case of documentation desynchronization, where a specific template was created or modified with rules that violate the master governing document.
*   **Impact:** This conflict directly caused the initial confusion. A user following the `roadmap-template.md` would be in direct violation of `README.md`, and vice-versa. It makes 100% compliance impossible.

### Recommendation:

*   **Harmonize Instructions:** The `roadmap-template.md` must be edited. The line "NO OTHER REPORTING, TRACKING, OR DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED FOR A ROADMAP" must be **removed**.
*   **Clarify Template Usage:** The template should be updated to state that it is to be used *in conjunction with* the other required documents (`analysis-report` and `progress`) as specified in the main `README.md`.

## 3. Additional Identified Conflicts and Ambiguities

### Finding 2: Redundant and Potentially Conflicting Master Guidelines

*   **The Issue:** There are two high-level project guideline documents: `active-project/README.md` and `active-project/project-guidelines/main-project-guidelines.md`. They have significant content overlap (e.g., core principles, naming conventions) but are not identical. `main-project-guidelines.md` is more philosophical and repo-wide, while `README.md` is specific to the `active-project/` workflow.
*   **Scenario:** A user could read one document and believe they have the full picture, not realizing a second, similar-but-different guideline document exists. A future change to one document might not be propagated to the other, worsening the desynchronization. For example, if the folder naming convention in `README.md` were to change, the diagram in `README.md` would need updating, but someone might not think to check `main-project-guidelines.md` for related text.
*   **Recommendation:**
    1.  **Establish a Clear Hierarchy:** `active-project/README.md` should be designated as the **single authoritative source** for the `active-project/` workflow structure and lifecycle.
    2.  **Refactor and Link:** `active-project/README.md` should link to `main-project-guidelines.md` for the overarching philosophical principles, but should not repeat them. The `README.md` should exclusively contain the structural and operational rules for the `active-project` directory.
    3.  **Remove Redundancy:** Any overlapping rules (like naming conventions) should be removed from `main-project-guidelines.md` to ensure they only exist in the more specific `README.md`.

### Finding 3: Ambiguous Progress Reporting Responsibility

*   **The Issue:** The guidelines create ambiguity about where sub-task progress should be reported.
    *   `active-project/README.md` states a sub-task needs a `l[n]-sl[n]-progress.md` file. It also says its content must be "summarized and appended" to the parent's progress file upon completion.
    *   `active-project/roadmap-template.md` mandates the use of a `roadmap-progress-tracker-template.md` and a `roadmap-checklist-template.md` for detailed progress.
*   **Scenario:** A user could diligently update the detailed progress tracker and checklist, but forget to populate the `l[n]-sl[n]-progress.md` file, or populate it with redundant information. It's unclear if "summary" means copying all commits or writing a prose summary, and when this summarization should occur (incrementally or only at the end).
*   **Recommendation:**
    1.  **Clarify Roles:** Define the purpose of each file explicitly within `active-project/README.md`:
        *   **Checklist (`...-checklist.md`):** For at-a-glance status of roadmap items (To-Do, In-Progress, Done).
        *   **Progress Tracker (`...-progress-tracker.md`):** The detailed, verbose log of actions, commits, and outputs. **This should be the primary source of truth for sub-task progress.**
        *   **Sub-task Progress File (`l[n]-sl[n]-progress.md`):** This file should be **deprecated**. It is redundant with the progress tracker. The process should instead be to append a *final summary* from the detailed progress tracker directly into the *parent's* progress file (`master-progress.md` or `l[parent]-sl[m]-progress.md`) upon sub-task completion.

### Finding 4: Missing Template and Unclear Analysis Scope

*   **The Issue:**
    1.  `active-project/README.md` references a template `../standards/templates/analysis-report-template.md` which **does not exist**.
    2.  The guidelines do not clearly differentiate between the scope and purpose of a `master-analysis-report.md` and a sub-task `l[n]-sl[n]-analysis-report.md`.
*   **Scenario:** A user trying to create a required sub-task analysis report has no template to follow. They might create a document that is far too detailed (a copy of the master report) or not detailed enough, failing to properly define the sub-task's scope, inputs, and exit criteria. This leads to inconsistent quality and potential rework.
*   **Recommendation:**
    1.  **Create the Missing Template:** A new file, `analysis-report-template.md`, must be created in `standards/templates/`.
    2.  **Define Scopes:** This new template, along with the `master-analysis-report-creation-guide.md`, must clearly define the two report types:
        *   **Master Analysis Report:** A high-level, strategic document defining the "what" and "why" of the entire initiative.
        *   **Sub-task Analysis Report:** A tactical, operational document defining the "how" for a *specific phase* of the project. It should detail the inputs, specific steps, dependencies, and verifiable exit criteria for that sub-task alone, inheriting its strategic goals from the master report.

### Finding 5: Ambiguous Branch Naming for Nested Tasks

*   **The Issue:** The branch naming convention in `active-project/README.md` is clear for top-level projects and first-level sub-tasks, but it's ambiguous for deeply nested tasks.
*   **Scenario:** Imagine a task at `.../l2-sl1-some-feature-active/l3-sl2-another-feature-active/`. According to the rule, should the branch name be `l3-sl2-another-feature-20250101-1200`? Or should it be the full path `l2-sl1-some-feature-l3-sl2-another-feature-20250101-1200` to provide full context? The current rule does not specify. This could lead to multiple branches from different parent tasks having the same name.
*   **Recommendation:**
    1.  **Clarify the Rule:** The guideline in `active-project/README.md` must be updated to be explicit.
    2.  **Proposed Rule:** The branch name should be based on the **full logical path** of the active folder, with slashes replaced by hyphens.
    3.  **Example:** For a task in `.../l2-sl1-feature-a/l3-sl2-feature-b-active/`, the branch name should be: `l2-sl1-feature-a-l3-sl2-feature-b-20250101-1200`. This ensures all branch names are unique and contextually rich.

## 4. Conclusion

The `active-project` management system is well-intentioned and highly detailed, but suffers from documentation drift and a lack of a single, unambiguous source of truth. The identified conflicts are not merely cosmetic; they create operational risk and will lead to recurring execution errors.

By implementing the recommendations in this reportâ€”harmonizing conflicting rules, clarifying ambiguities, creating missing templates, and establishing a clear document hierarchyâ€”the system can be made robust, resilient, and fully compliant with its own foundational principle of being a Single Source of Truth.
