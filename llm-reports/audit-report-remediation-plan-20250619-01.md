# Audit Report: Remediation Investigation Plan

This document presents a formal audit of the instructional plan detailed in `llm-reports/remediation-investigation-plan-20250619.md`. The audit process involved a thorough, fact-based investigation to verify the plausibility, reasoning, and correctness of each proposed remediation task.

---

## Executive Summary

The audited Remediation Investigation Plan is, on the whole, **highly plausible and well-reasoned**. Its proposals are strategically aligned with the repository's foundational principles of automation and maintaining a single source of truth. The plan correctly identifies several critical areas for remediation and proposes technically sound solutions.

However, the audit has identified **three specific factual inaccuracies** within the plan's analysis that must be corrected before implementation. These inaccuracies do not invalidate the overall strategy but require adjustments to the instructional steps for successful execution.

**Overall Verdict:** **Approved with Mandatory Revisions.** The plan is fit for purpose, pending the corrections detailed below.

---

## 1. Invalid References to Obsolete Collection Documents

### A. Plausibility of Instructions
The instructional plan is **highly plausible**.
-   The use of `grep` (or its PowerShell equivalent `Select-String`) is appropriate for identifying affected files.
-   The analysis of `tools/builder/generate_collections.py` confirms it is a sophisticated tool for creating dynamic collections, making the old static files obsolete.
-   The proposal to create a mapping and then a correction script is a logical workflow.

### B. Reasoning
**Approved.** The reasoning is sound and factually correct.
-   **Verification:** The audit confirmed via `Select-String` that exactly **12 files** contain references to the two obsolete collection documents (`COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md` and `COL-LINKING-UNIVERSAL.md`), precisely matching the plan's analysis.
-   **Conclusion:** The problem is accurately diagnosed.

### C. Alternative Methodologies
No alternative is recommended. The proposed plan is optimal.

## 2. System-Wide Changelog Removal

### A. Plausibility of Instructions
The instructional plan is **highly plausible**. A script to parse YAML frontmatter and remove a specific key is a standard, low-risk automation task.

### B. Reasoning
**Approved with revision.** The reasoning is sound, but the factual basis is slightly inaccurate.
-   **Verification:** The audit confirmed via `Select-String` that **68 files**, not 71, currently contain the `change_log_url` key.
-   **Conclusion:** While the exact count was off by three, this discrepancy is minor and does not change the nature of the task. The proposed solution is correct. The plan should be updated to reflect the correct count of 68.

### C. Alternative Methodologies
No alternative is recommended.

## 3. Promotion of Critical Standards from 'Draft' to 'Active'

### A. Plausibility of Instructions
The instructional plan is **plausible and necessary**. The proposed "Expert Review Checklist" is a crucial quality gate that aligns with enterprise standards.

### B. Reasoning
**Approved with revision.** The reasoning is sound, but the factual basis is significantly inaccurate.
-   **Verification (Count):** The audit confirmed via `Select-String` that **55 files**, not 40, currently have the `status/draft` tag. This is a 37.5% increase in scope.
-   **Verification (Incompleteness):** The audit of the example file (`AS-KB-DIRECTORY-STRUCTURE.md`) confirmed it contains multiple placeholders and notes indicating it is incomplete (e.g., `[MISSING_CHANGE_LOG_URL]`, `(To Be Expanded)`).
-   **Conclusion:** The core problem—that numerous draft files are incomplete and require rigorous review—is correctly identified. The instructional plan is robust, but the scope of work is larger than stated. The plan must be updated to reflect the correct count of 55.

### C. Alternative Methodologies
No alternative is recommended. The proposed formal review process is essential for maintaining quality.

## 4. Synchronization of Architectural Counts and Navigation

### A. Plausibility of Instructions
The instructional plan is **highly plausible**. The proposal to create a new script (`update_architecture_docs.py`) to consume the master index and automatically update the architectural documents is an excellent example of the project's automation-first principle.

### B. Reasoning
**Approved with critical revision.** The reasoning is sound, but a key detail in the instructional plan is incorrect.
-   **Verification (Stale Docs):** The audit of `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` and `AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB.md` confirmed they contain manually-maintained, hardcoded, and out-of-date lists and counts.
-   **Verification (Data Source):** The audit of the master index file confirms it contains the necessary structured data (e.g., `primary_domain`, `standard_id`, `title`) to power the proposed automation.
-   **Critical Error:** The plan specifies the input file path as `dist/master-index.jsonld`. **This path is incorrect.** The file does not exist there. The correct path, verified during the audit, is `standards/registry/master-index.jsonld`.
-   **Conclusion:** The strategy is correct, but the plan would fail as written. The file path **must** be corrected in the plan before any implementation attempt.

### C. Alternative Methodologies
No alternative is recommended. The proposed solution is the correct long-term fix.

## 5. Correction of Tagging and Taxonomy

### A. Plausibility of Instructions
The instructional plan is **highly plausible**. It involves a simple manual correction and a minor logic addition to the new script proposed in Section 4.

### B. Reasoning
**Approved.** The reasoning is sound and aligns perfectly with the established three-layer architectural principles.
-   **Verification:** The audit confirmed that `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` (the Presentation Layer) is incorrectly tagged with `content-type/standard-definition`. This contradicts its purpose.
-   **Conclusion:** The analysis is correct. Separating concepts from standards in the navigation is a logical refinement that improves taxonomic clarity.

### C. Alternative Methodologies
No alternative is recommended. The proposed actions are correct.
