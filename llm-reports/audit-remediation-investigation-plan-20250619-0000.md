# Audit Report – Remediation Investigation Plan (2025-06-19)

## 1. Audit Objective
To evaluate the **plausibility** and **soundness of reasoning** behind each instruction set contained in `llm-reports/remediation-investigation-plan-20250619.md` and, where a deficiency is identified, to propose a superior alternative methodology.

## 2. Audit Methodology
1. **Document Examination** – full read-through of the remediation plan.
2. **Repository Verification** – targeted searches (`grep_search`) and code inspection (`read_file`) to confirm or refute factual claims.
3. **Cross-Reference** – validation against foundational principles, existing tooling, and standards architecture.
4. **Assessment Criteria** – each remediation item rated on:
   * **Instruction Plausibility** – can the steps be executed with current repo state/tooling?
   * **Reasoning Adequacy** – is the underlying logic fact-based and aligned with governing principles?

## 3. Findings Summary (Pass / Fail Matrix)
| # | Instruction Theme | Plausibility | Reasoning | Overall Verdict |
|---|-------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Fix obsolete collection references | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass | **Approved** |
| 2 | Remove `change_log_url` everywhere | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass | **Approved** |
| 3 | Promote drafts to active | ⚠️ Partial* | ✅ Pass | **Conditionally Approved** |
| 4 | Sync architecture counts/navigation | ❌ Fail | ⚠️ Partial | **Denied – Revision Required** |
| 5 | Correct tagging & taxonomy | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass | **Approved** |

\* *Draft count cited as "40"; current grep indicates >50. This variance does not invalidate the workflow but requires dynamic counting.*

## 4. Detailed Analysis & Recommendations

### 4.1 Item 1 – Invalid References to Obsolete Collection Documents
* **Verification** – `grep` confirmed ≥12 active standards referencing `COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md` or `COL-LINKING-UNIVERSAL.md` (files now archived). The claim is accurate.
* **Plausibility** – Identification via search + scripted replacement is feasible. `tools/builder/generate_collections.py` already supersedes the old static collections, so eliminating legacy citations is mandatory.
* **Reasoning** – Mapping old rule IDs to new atomic standards preserves traceability and complies with SST principle.
* **Verdict** – **Approved** – no superior alternative required.

### 4.2 Item 2 – System-Wide Changelog Removal
* **Verification** – Multiple standards still include `change_log_url`. No downstream tooling depends on this key (confirmed by inspecting `generate_collections.py` and `kb_linter.py`).
* **Plausibility** – YAML parsing + key deletion script is straightforward; dry-run + verification steps follow policy 3.2.
* **Reasoning** – Full removal aligns with user mandate and avoids null placeholders.
* **Verdict** – **Approved**.

### 4.3 Item 3 – Promotion of Draft Standards
* **Verification** – `grep` revealed >50 documents tagged `status/draft`, not 40. Nevertheless, a checklist-driven review process is valid.
* **Plausibility** – Expert checklist & remediation tasks are implementable; however, the draft count should be derived programmatically (e.g., from `master-index.jsonld`).
* **Reasoning** – Checklist items map cleanly to quality gates stated in project guidelines (completeness, link integrity, etc.).
* **Alternative Recommendation (Minor Enhancement)** – Replace hard-coded "40" with dynamic enumeration via the index to prevent drift.
* **Verdict** – **Conditionally Approved**.

### 4.4 Item 4 – Synchronization of Architectural Counts & Navigation
* **Verification** – `generate_index.py` outputs to `standards/registry/master-index.jsonld` (default), **not** `dist/master-index.jsonld` as stated.
* **Plausibility** – The described synchronizer logic is conceptually sound but references a non-existent path; without correction the script will fail.
* **Reasoning** – Need for automation is justified; however, path misalignment violates "zero assumptions" policy and hence reasoning is only partially acceptable.
* **Verdict** – **Denied – Revision Required**.
* **Superior Alternative Methodology**
  1. **Input Source** – Consume `standards/registry/master-index.jsonld` (guaranteed current from `generate_index.py`).
  2. **Placement** – House new utility under `tools/builder/update_architecture_docs.py` as proposed.
  3. **Logic Enhancements** –
     * Derive draft vs active counts to keep logical/presentation layer segregation accurate.
     * Output summary log to `tools/reports/` for audit trail.
  4. **CI Integration** – Trigger synchronizer **immediately after** `generate_index.py` within the same make-phase to maintain atomicity.

### 4.5 Item 5 – Tagging & Taxonomy Corrections
* **Verification** – `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` currently carries `content-type/standard-definition`; this contradicts its role as presentation layer.
* **Plausibility** – Manual tag removal + updated navigation logic (concept separation) is feasible and correctly segregates concepts vs standards.
* **Reasoning** – Aligns with three-layer architecture and taxonomy best practices.
* **Verdict** – **Approved**.

## 5. Conclusion
Four of the five remediation instruction sets are **approved** or **conditionally approved**. Item 4 requires path correction and minor logic augmentation before implementation can proceed in compliance with foundational principles.
