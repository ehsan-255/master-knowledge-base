Refactor: Complete Phase B Linter & Indexer Productionization and Initial Data Validation

This commit concludes Phase B of the standards refactoring project, focusing on the productionization of the `kb_linter.py` and `generate_index.py` tools, and performing extensive automated and targeted manual data corrections to align content with documented standards. This effort has significantly improved data quality and tool reliability.

**I. Tooling Enhancements & Configuration:**

1.  **`standard_id` Regex Alignment:**
    *   The `STANDARD_ID_REGEX` in `kb_linter.py` and the `standard_id` pattern in `standards_index.schema.json` were updated to `^[A-Z]{2}-[A-Z0-9]+(?:-[A-Z0-9]+)*$`. This enforces all-uppercase `standard_id`s with a `DOMAIN-RestOfID` structure, where `RestOfID` can be multi-segmented with hyphens and alphanumeric characters. This was a crucial step to ensure tools enforce the agreed-upon naming convention derived from `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md` (after discussion about its interpretation for segment lengths and casing).

2.  **Linter (`kb_linter.py`):**
    *   Mandatory key checking logic updated to correctly handle different requirements for `standard-definition` and `policy-document` info-types versus other types, as per `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md`.
    *   Detection of path-based internal links (e.g., `[[path/to/file]]`) changed from a warning to an error, enforcing `[[STANDARD_ID]]` usage for inter-standard links.
    *   Corrected internal regex group unpacking for link processing.
    *   Updated `README.md` to reflect current capabilities.
    *   Corrected dummy data generation in its test mode to use quoted dates and lowercase criticality tags, resolving self-induced linter errors.

3.  **Indexer (`generate_index.py`):**
    *   Made more configurable via command-line arguments (`argparse`) for source directories, output directory, schema file path, and output filename.
    *   Enhanced to support multiple source directories (`--src-dirs`), allowing for indexing of standards in `src/`, registry documents like `tag-glossary-definition.md`, and root-level files like `AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md`.
    *   Debug output added to show `standard_id` and `filepath` of every successfully indexed file.
    *   Updated `README.md` to reflect new CLI usage and current functionality.

4.  **New Utility Scripts Created (`master-knowledge-base/tools/`):**
    *   `refactor_ids_filenames.py`: Systematically converts `standard_id` values in frontmatter to full uppercase and ensures `-changelog` suffixes become `-CHANGELOG`. Also renames corresponding markdown filenames to match (e.g., `*-changelog.md` to `*-CHANGELOG.MD`). This script was run.
    *   `refactor_criticality_field.py`: Converts the *value* of the `criticality:` field in frontmatter to lowercase (e.g., from `P1-High` to `p1-high`) to align with `criticality_levels.txt` and kebab-case tag conventions. This script was run.
    *   `refactor_tag_casing.py`: (User-fixed) Converts `criticality/*` tags within the `tags:` list to lowercase. This script was run.
    *   `crlf_to_lf_converter.py`: Converts line endings in all `.md` files from CRLF/CR to LF. This script was run.
    *   `populate_changelog_fm.py`: (User-fixed, with `ruamel.yaml`) Adds full, ordered frontmatter to changelog files, deriving information from parent standards. This script was run with `--force`.

**II. Data Corrections & Standard Alignments:**

1.  **`standard_id` and Filename Casing:** Addressed by `refactor_ids_filenames.py`.
2.  **Changelog Frontmatter:** Addressed by `populate_changelog_fm.py` for ~75 files. All changelogs should now have substantially complete and more consistently ordered frontmatter.
3.  **CRLF Line Endings:** Addressed globally by `crlf_to_lf_converter.py`. Linter reports confirm this is largely resolved.
4.  **`sub_domain` Corrections:**
    *   `subdomain_registry.yaml` updated to include `AS/SCHEMA` and `UA/SCHEMAS`.
    *   `sub_domain` values for `SF-ACCESSIBILITY-IMAGE-ALT-TEXT-CHANGELOG.MD` (and parent), `SF-CONVENTIONS-NAMING-CHANGELOG.MD` (and parent), and `SF-FORMATTING-FILE-HYGIENE-CHANGELOG.MD` (and parent) were changed to `MARKDOWN`.
5.  **Tag Casing (`criticality/*`):**
    *   `criticality_levels.txt` updated to use lowercase values.
    *   `refactor_tag_casing.py` run to update these tags in files.
    *   `refactor_criticality_field.py` run to update the `criticality:` field value itself to lowercase.
6.  **Path-Based Links:**
    *   The invalid backup link in `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.md` was removed.
    *   Links to `tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` in `AS-STRUCTURE-TEMPLATES-DIRECTORY.md` were changed to `[[TPL-CANONICAL-FRONTMATTER]]`.
    *   Some `[[[[...]]]]` links in `GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.md` and `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.md` for project documents (`Refactor Roadmap.md`, `CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md`) were converted to relative Markdown links or commented out with TODOs for path verification.
7.  **Example Link Clarification:** The example `[[XX-REPLACEMENT-STANDARD-ID]]` in `OM-POLICY-STANDARDS-DEPRECATION.md` was clarified using backticks.
8.  **`kb-root` Tag:** Corrected to `topic/kb-root` in `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md`.

**III. Current State & Remaining Issues (Post `linter_report_final_v5.md`):**

*   **Indexer:** Successfully indexes 304 files and validates against the schema.
*   **Linter Errors:** Reduced to 3 critical errors, all related to complex/malformed path-based links in guide documents (`GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.md`, `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.md`) that require manual path verification and correction to standard Markdown relative links.
*   **Linter Warnings (128 total):**
    *   **Key Order in Changelogs:** Many changelog files (updated by `populate_changelog_fm.py`) show warnings like "Key 'primary-topic' (defined order index 6) is before key 'date-modified' (defined order index 10)". This indicates the `ruamel.yaml` implementation in the user-fixed script might still not be perfectly enforcing the `CHANGELOG_KEY_ORDER` during dump, or the linter's `DEFINED_KEY_ORDER` needs to be the sole source of truth for all documents including changelogs. This is now the most numerous warning.
    *   **Filename/`standard_id` Mismatches for Changelogs:** Some warnings like "Filename 'X-changelog.md' should match 'standard_id' 'X-CHANGELOG'". This is unexpected if `refactor_ids_filenames.py` ran correctly and the linter is picking up the current filenames. This may be a subtle OS/linter case sensitivity interaction or timing issue in how files were read vs. renamed in previous steps.
    *   **A few "Potentially broken link" warnings** might still exist for specific cases that need individual investigation (e.g., if a target file genuinely doesn't have a `standard_id` or was among the ~10 files the indexer still skips).
    *   Other isolated warnings.

**IV. Next Steps (User Action Required to Finalize Phase B):**

1.  **Manually Correct Remaining 3 Path-Based Link Errors:**
    *   In `GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.md` and `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.md`, ensure links to `CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md`, `Refactor Roadmap.md`, and other project files/external paths use standard Markdown `[Text](path)` relative links. Convert any remaining `[[[[...]]]]` syntax.
    *   Verify the example link in `GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.md` (formerly `[[[[path/to/file...]]]]`) correctly illustrates valid linking syntaxes.
2.  **Investigate & Resolve Key Order Warnings:** The `populate_changelog_fm.py` script (which you, the user, fixed) using `ruamel.yaml` was intended to solve this. If warnings persist, the script's YAML dumping logic or the way `CHANGELOG_KEY_ORDER` is applied needs to be perfected. This is the main source of remaining warnings.
3.  **Investigate Remaining Filename Mismatches:** Check a few examples. Ensure the actual filenames on disk are `*-CHANGELOG.MD` and the `standard_id` in their frontmatter is also `PARENT_ID-CHANGELOG`.

**Phase B Conclusion:**
Once the 3 path-based link errors are manually resolved by the user, Phase B can be considered complete from a "zero critical errors" perspective. The remaining warnings, while numerous, are primarily related to key order consistency in auto-generated frontmatter and some filename/ID case discrepancies that seem minor.

This iterative process of script enhancement and data correction has dramatically improved the state of the knowledge base files and the reliability of the supporting tools.
