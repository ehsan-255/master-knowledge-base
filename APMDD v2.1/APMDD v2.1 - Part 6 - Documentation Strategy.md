# APMDD v2.1 - Documentation Strategy
#apmdd-documentation #apmdd-ssot

In AI-Powered Model-Driven Development (APMDD) v2.1, documentation is not a peripheral activity but a cornerstone of the methodology. It serves as a critical enabler for effective communication, [[APMDD v2.1 - Part 8 - Glossary#Context Drift|AI context management]], long-term maintainability, and governance.

## 6.1. Documentation as a First-Class Artifact
#apmdd-documentation
Documentation in APMDD v2.1 is not an afterthought but a core, living artifact. It is created, maintained, and consumed throughout the lifecycle by both human architects and the AI team. All documentation is managed in Obsidian and follows DITA-inspired principles (see [[APMDD v2.1 - Part 8 - Glossary#Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA)]]).

## 6.2. Single Source of Truth: Models + Documentation + Code
#apmdd-ssot
The "Single Source of Truth" (SSoT) principle mandates that all critical information—models, documentation, and code—be maintained in a unified, authoritative set of artifacts. (See [[APMDD v2.1 - Part 8 - Glossary#Single Source of Truth (SSoT)]]).

APMDD v2.1 explicitly defines the SSoT as the combination of:

1.  **Models:** Primarily the C4-DSL model file(s) (for architectural structure, from which C4 diagrams are generated as views), and complementary PlantUML diagrams (for behavioral and non-C4 structural models). See [[APMDD v2.1 - Part 4 - Modeling Types, Strategy & Notations]] for details on modeling strategy and mandated notations.
2.  **Documentation:** The surrounding textual explanations, specifications (e.g., detailed HMA Port contracts, Event schemas), design rationale, user guides, and operational procedures. This APMDD v2.1 methodology itself is part of this documentation layer.
3.  **Code:** The actual source code generated by the AI team, which implements the designs specified in the models and documentation.

As stated in previous clarifications, even though models are critical drivers, they are primarily visual or textual. Therefore, the comprehensive understanding of the system relies on all three components being consistent and interlinked. The SSoT principle aims to ensure that any piece of information is authoritatively defined in one place, minimizing contradictions and providing a reliable foundation for all development activities.

## 6.3. Documentation Structure
#apmdd-documentation
- Modular notes, each covering a specific aspect (see [[APMDD v2.0 - Part 0 - Table of Contents]])
- Extensive semantic linking (cross-note, glossary, HMA, lifecycle, etc.)
- Tagging for thematic search (e.g., #apmdd-principle, #apmdd-hma-alignment)
- Persistent, versioned, and continuously updated

## 6.4. DITA-Inspired Practices
#apmdd-documentation
- Modular topics and reusable content blocks
- Semantic richness and clear structure
- Topic-based authoring and referencing

## 6.5. AI-Readable Documentation
#apmdd-documentation
- Clear, precise, and unambiguous language
- Explicit links to models, code, and glossary terms
- Consistent structure and formatting

## 6.6. Documentation in the Lifecycle
#apmdd-documentation #apmdd-lifecycle-phase
- Created and updated in every phase (see [[APMDD v2.0 - Part 3 - Lifecycle - Integrating MDA and Agile Practices]])
- Used as external memory for AI agents
- Supports onboarding, governance, and quality assurance

## 6.7. Summary
#apmdd-documentation
Documentation is a strategic asset in APMDD v2.1, enabling effective human-AI collaboration, governance, and maintainability.

## 6.1. Documentation Philosophy
<!-- #apmdd-documentation -->
The APMDD documentation philosophy is rooted in the understanding that [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI teams]] require clear, precise, structured, and readily accessible information to perform effectively. Key tenets include:

*   **Documentation is Key and Mandatory:** As highlighted in [[APMDD v1.2 Clarifications.md|Clarifications, "Goals & Motivations"]], comprehensive documentation is mandatory and integral to the development lifecycle. It is not an optional or delayed task.
*   **Structured and Hierarchical:** Documentation must follow a well-defined structure, making it easy for both humans and AI to navigate and locate specific information. The use of Obsidian notes with semantic linking supports this.
*   **Single Source of Truth (SSoT) Component:** Documentation, alongside [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|models]] and code, forms the collective [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Single Source of Truth (SSoT)|Single Source of Truth]]. This minimizes redundancy and ensures consistency.
*   **Living and Continuous:** Documentation is not a one-time deliverable but a living artifact that evolves with the system. It is created and updated continuously throughout all lifecycle phases. This aligns with [[APMDD v2.0 - Core Principles, Concepts & Roles#2.1. Guiding Principles of APMDD v2.0|APMDD Principle: Continuous, Living, DITA-Inspired Documentation]].
*   **Quality over Quantity:** While comprehensive, documentation should also be concise and focused. High-level overviews are preferred where appropriate, with details provided for specifications directly consumed by AI (e.g., [[Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification v1.2|HMA]] [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Port|Port]] definitions).
*   **Accessibility for Humans and AI:** Documentation must be created in formats and styles that are easily parseable, understandable, and actionable by both human architects and [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI development agents]].

This philosophy ensures that documentation actively supports the APMDD goals of mitigating AI limitations and fostering efficient human-AI collaboration.

## 6.2. Single Source of Truth: Models + Documentation + Code
<!-- #apmdd-documentation -->
APMDD v2.1 explicitly defines the [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Single Source of Truth (SSoT)|Single Source of Truth (SSoT)]] as the combination of:

1.  **[[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|Models]]:** Primarily the C4-DSL model file(s) (for architectural structure, from which C4 diagrams are generated as views), and complementary PlantUML diagrams (for behavioral and non-C4 structural models). See [[APMDD v2.1 - Part 4 - Modeling Types, Strategy & Notations]] for details on modeling strategy and mandated notations.
2.  **Documentation:** The surrounding textual explanations, specifications (e.g., detailed [[Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification v1.2|HMA]] [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Port|Port]] contracts, [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Event|Event]] schemas), design rationale, user guides, and operational procedures. This APMDD v2.1 methodology itself is part of this documentation layer.
3.  **Code:** The actual source code generated by the [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI team]], which implements the designs specified in the models and documentation.

As stated in [[APMDD v1.2 Clarifications.md|Clarifications Q3]], even though [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|models]] are critical drivers, they are primarily visual or textual. Therefore, the comprehensive understanding of the system relies on all three components being consistent and interlinked. The SSoT principle aims to ensure that any piece of information is authoritatively defined in one place, minimizing contradictions and providing a reliable foundation for all development activities.

## 6.3. Documentation Tooling: DITA-Inspired Principles with Obsidian (Mandatory)
<!-- #apmdd-documentation #apmdd-governance -->
To support the documentation philosophy and ensure consistency, APMDD v2.1 mandates specific tooling and principles:

*   **Tooling:** **Obsidian** is the mandatory tool for creating and managing the APMDD methodology documentation and project-specific design documentation.
    *   **Rationale (as per [[APMDD v1.2 Clarifications.md|Clarifications Q20]]):** The "tighter the mold, the better the statue." Obsidian's features, such as bi-directional linking, tagging, and support for embedding [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PlantUML|PlantUML]] diagrams (and other code/text formats), make it well-suited for creating the interconnected, living documentation APMDD requires. Its local-first, Markdown-based nature also facilitates version control with Git.
*   **[[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#DITA|DITA]]-Inspired Principles:** While not mandating full DITA XML, APMDD requires adherence to DITA-inspired principles for structuring documentation:
    *   **Topic-Based Authoring:** Information is organized into modular, self-contained topics (like these Obsidian notes or sections within them). Each topic should have a clear purpose and cover a specific subject.
    *   **Semantic Markup:** Use Markdown (and potentially embedded HTML where necessary and supported) in a way that conveys semantic meaning (e.g., clear headings, lists, code blocks). This aids AI parseability.
    *   **Content Reuse (Conceptual):** Strive to define information once and link/transclude it where needed, rather than duplicating it. Obsidian's linking and embedding features support this.
    *   **Information Typing (Conceptual):** Distinguish between different types of information (e.g., concepts, tasks, references) and structure them accordingly. For example, [[Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification v1.2|HMA]] [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Port|Port]] definitions are "reference" information, while a lifecycle phase description is "concept" or "task" information.

This combination of Obsidian and DITA-inspired principles aims to create documentation that is highly structured, navigable, maintainable, and optimized for consumption by both human architects and [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI agents]]. This approach aligns with [[APMDD v1.2.md|APMDD v1.2, Section 8]], emphasizing models as first-class artifacts, single-sourcing, and accessibility.

## 6.4. Levels, Types, and Methods of Documentation
<!-- #apmdd-documentation #apmdd-artifact -->
APMDD v2.1 requires various types of documentation artifacts, created and maintained throughout the lifecycle. These cater to different needs and audiences:

*   **Methodology Documentation:**
    *   This APMDD v2.1 documentation set itself, including principles, lifecycle, roles, modeling guidelines, and the mandated architecture overview.
    *   The companion [[Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification v1.2]] document.
*   **Requirements Documentation (Primarily [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#CIM|CIM]] Phase):**
    *   User Stories, Use Cases ([[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PlantUML|PlantUML]] Use Case Diagrams).
    *   Business Process Models ([[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PlantUML|PlantUML]] Activity Diagrams).
    *   Conceptual Domain Models.
    *   Non-Functional Requirements.
*   **Architectural & Design Documentation (Primarily [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PIM|PIM]] & [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PSM|PSM]] Phases):**
    *   [[Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification v1.2|HMA]] Structural Models ([[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PlantUML|PlantUML]] C4 Component diagrams for Core, [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Plugin|Plugins]], [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Orchestrator Plugin|Orchestrators]]).
    *   Interface Specifications:
        *   [[Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification v1.2|HMA]] [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Port|Port]] Definitions (detailing operations, parameters, return types).
        *   [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Event|Event]] Schemas (e.g., JSON Schema, Avro) for [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Event Bus|Event Bus]] communication.
        *   API Contracts for L1 [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Adapter|Adapters]] (e.g., OpenAPI, AsyncAPI specifications).
    *   Interaction Models ([[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PlantUML|PlantUML]] Sequence Diagrams for [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Port|Port]] calls, [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Event|Event]] flows).
    *   Behavioral Models ([[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PlantUML|PlantUML]] State Diagrams for [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Plugin|Plugin]] lifecycles).
    *   Detailed [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Plugin|Plugin]] Internal Design notes/diagrams (if necessary for complex [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Plugin|Plugins]]).
    *   Deployment Diagrams.
    *   Design Rationale: Justification for key architectural and design decisions.
*   **Implementation & Test Documentation (Primarily [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PSM|PSM]] Phase):**
    *   Code Comments (generated or reviewed for clarity).
    *   Test Plans and Test Case Specifications (especially for critical integration points or [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Port|Port]] contracts).
    *   Automated test scripts (which themselves serve as executable documentation).
*   **Operational Documentation (Primarily Deployment & Operation Phase):**
    *   Deployment Guides.
    *   Operational Runbooks.
    *   Monitoring and Alerting Guides.
*   **User Documentation (If Applicable):**
    *   User Manuals, Guides, API usage documentation for external consumers.

The [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI team]] plays a significant role in generating and assisting with the drafting of much of this documentation, under the guidance and validation of the human [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Architect (Human)|Architect]].

## 6.5. Continuous, Living Documentation Practices
<!-- #apmdd-documentation -->
To maintain the value and accuracy of documentation as a [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Single Source of Truth (SSoT)|Single Source of Truth]], APMDD v2.1 emphasizes continuous and living documentation practices:

*   **Document Alongside Development:** Documentation is created and updated in parallel with modeling, design, and implementation activities, not as a separate, later phase. Changes to [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|models]] or code should trigger corresponding updates in documentation.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Documentation, like [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|models]] and code, is subject to iterative refinement. Initial drafts may be high-level, with details filled in as understanding evolves and decisions are made.
*   **Integration with Workflow:** Documentation tasks are integrated into the development workflow (e.g., sprint planning, definition of done for [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Plugin|Plugin]] development).
*   **[[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI-Assisted Generation & Maintenance]]:** Leverage AI capabilities to draft initial documentation from [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|models]] or code, update documentation based on changes, and check for consistency. However, human [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Architect (Human)|Architect]] review and validation remain crucial.
*   **Regular Reviews:** Documentation should be periodically reviewed for accuracy, clarity, and completeness, especially for critical specifications like [[Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification v1.2|HMA]] [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Port|Port]] contracts. This aligns with [[APMDD v1.2.md|APMDD v1.2, Guiding Principle 6]].
*   **Traceability:** Maintain traceability links between requirements, [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|models]], documentation sections, and code components to understand impact and ensure consistency.

These practices ensure that the documentation remains a reliable and up-to-date resource throughout the system's lifecycle.

## 6.6. Rigorous Version Control for Documentation
<!-- #apmdd-documentation #apmdd-governance -->
Consistent with treating documentation as a critical component of the [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Single Source of Truth (SSoT)|Single Source of Truth]], all documentation artifacts must be under rigorous version control.

*   **Mandated Tool:** **Git** is the mandated version control system for all documentation artifacts, including Obsidian Markdown files (`.md`), [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PlantUML|PlantUML]] source files (`.puml`, `.plantuml` if stored alongside docs), and any other textual specification files.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Obsidian notes are Markdown-based (text), making them ideal for Git.
    *   Provides history, branching, merging, and collaborative capabilities.
    *   Ensures consistency with version control practices for [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|models]] (see [[APMDD v2.0 - Modeling Types, Strategy & Notations#4.6. Model Repository & Version Control|Model Repository & Version Control]]) and code.
*   **Repository Structure:** Documentation should be organized logically within the Git repository, often alongside the [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|models]] and code it pertains to, or in a dedicated documentation repository linked to the project.
*   **Commit Practices:** Clear, descriptive commit messages are essential for tracking changes to documentation and understanding its evolution.
*   **Release Tagging:** Documentation versions should be tagged in alignment with software releases to ensure that the documentation corresponding to a specific system version can be easily retrieved.

By applying disciplined version control to documentation, APMDD v2.1 ensures its integrity, traceability, and reliability as a long-term asset.
