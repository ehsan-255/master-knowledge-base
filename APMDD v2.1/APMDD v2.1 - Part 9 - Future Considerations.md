## 9.3. Open Questions
#apmdd-future
- How can AI agents be further empowered to manage architectural drift?
- What new governance mechanisms are needed as AI capabilities evolve?
- How can documentation and models be made even more AI-interpretable?

## 9.4. Summary
#apmdd-future
Future versions of APMDD will address these and other topics as the methodology evolves to meet new challenges in AI-led development.

AI-Powered Model-Driven Development (APMDD) v2.0 establishes a foundational methodology for AI-led software development. However, the field of AI and its application in software engineering is rapidly evolving. This document outlines topics and potential enhancements that are considered out-of-scope for the current v2.0 release but are identified as valuable areas for future exploration and inclusion in subsequent APMDD versions (e.g., APMDD v2.x).

The following topics have been deferred as per [[APMDD v1.2 Clarifications.md|Clarifications Q15]] (regarding "Advanced Topics" from [[APMDD v1.2 Changes to Merge.md|Changes, Part 7]]) and other specific deferrals:

1.  **Advanced AI-Driven Model Transformations & Code Generation:**
    *   Exploring more sophisticated AI capabilities for model-to-model (M2M) transformations (e.g., automated refinement from [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#CIM|CIM]] to [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PIM|PIM]], or [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PIM|PIM]] to [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PSM|PSM]] skeletons) beyond the current definition of the [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI team]] as the "intelligent transformation engine."
    *   Investigating AI techniques for more complex or adaptive code generation strategies.

2.  **Ensuring Model Promises are Kept by Code (Advanced Verification):**
    *   Developing more advanced techniques or AI-driven tools for formally verifying or ensuring greater consistency between high-level models ([[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PIM|PIM]]) and the [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI-generated]] code ([[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PSM|PSM]] implementation), beyond current testing and review practices.

3.  **Managing Adaptations and Manual Changes in AI-Generated Code:**
    *   Defining robust strategies for handling scenarios where human developers might need to make manual modifications to [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI-generated]] code.
    *   How to reconcile such changes with the original models and prevent divergence, or how AI can assist in re-integrating manual changes back into model-driven flows.

4.  **Alternative Development Styles and Flows:**
    *   Investigating and providing guidance on alternative development styles, such as more bottom-up approaches to [[Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification v1.2|HMA]] [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Plugin|Plugin]] identification or refinement, if applicable within the APMDD framework.
    *   Exploring variations in the PIM-to-PSM transition based on different project contexts or AI capabilities.

5.  **Advanced Documentation Best Practices & Automation:**
    *   Further refinement of documentation strategies, potentially including more sophisticated AI-driven documentation generation, maintenance, and validation tools.
    *   Deeper integration of documentation with [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|models]] for dynamic updates.

6.  **The Evolving Role of Reviews in APMDD:**
    *   Exploring how AI can play a more significant role in the review process itself (e.g., AI-assisted code reviews focusing on specific concerns, AI validation of model consistency).
    *   Refining review guidelines for different types of [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI-generated]] artifacts.

7.  **Handling Large-Scale or Numerous Interconnected Models:**
    *   Developing strategies and tooling recommendations for managing very large sets of [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#PlantUML|PlantUML]] models or highly complex inter-model dependencies, beyond standard Git version control and current Obsidian capabilities.
    *   Techniques for model federation or modularization at a larger scale.

8.  **Addressing Challenges and Limitations in APMDD Implementation (Advanced):**
    *   A deeper dive into more complex challenges that might arise in mature APMDD implementations and proposing advanced mitigation strategies or patterns.

9.  **Integrating Pre-existing / Legacy Code:** <!-- #apmdd-future -->
    *   As per [[APMDD v1.2 Clarifications.md|Clarifications Q22]], defining a formal migration path or strategies for incorporating pre-existing or legacy codebases into an APMDD project. This could involve techniques for reverse-engineering [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#Model|models]] from code, or patterns for wrapping legacy modules as [[Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification v1.2|HMA Plugins]].

10. **Detailed Security Patterns and Practices:**
    *   Expanding on the foundational security principles in APMDD v2.0 and the [[Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification v1.2]] by defining more specific security patterns, threat modeling techniques tailored for HMA, and best practices for securing [[APMDD v2.0 - Glossary#AI Team|AI-developed]] systems.

11. **Advanced AI Collaboration Patterns:**
    *   Defining more nuanced patterns for human-AI collaboration, including dynamic task allocation, AI-initiated design suggestions, and more autonomous AI roles in governance and decision-making under architect supervision.

12. **Ethical Considerations in AI-Led Development:**
    *   Addressing ethical considerations, biases, and accountability related to the use of AI in software development, and how APMDD might incorporate principles or practices to manage these.

13. **Tooling and Platform Evolution:**
    *   Adapting APMDD to leverage new AI development tools, platforms, and advancements in LLM capabilities as they emerge.
    *   Potentially moving beyond a strict Obsidian mandate if alternative tools can provably meet DITA-inspired principles and AI-parseability requirements.

These topics represent areas where APMDD can continue to evolve, providing even more comprehensive guidance for the future of AI-augmented software engineering. Feedback from practitioners applying APMDD v2.0 will be invaluable in prioritizing and shaping these future considerations.
