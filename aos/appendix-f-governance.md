### Appendix F: Governance & Operational Excellence

#### F.1 Semantic Ontology Management (Critique 27)
AOS v5.0 adopts a federated ontology model to ensure scalability and manageability.
- **CORE Ontology:** A minimal, centrally governed set of classes and properties essential for framework interoperability (as defined in `appendix-a-ontology.md`). Changes require approval from an **Ontology Steward Circle**.
- **CONTEXT Ontologies:** Team- or domain-specific extensions that import the CORE ontology. These can be evolved more rapidly by local teams.
- **Governance:** Changes to the CORE ontology are managed via pull requests with automated diff-reporting and require at least two approvals from the Steward Circle.

#### F.2 Informal Knowledge Capture (Critique 47)
To capture innovation that occurs outside formal processes, AOS v5.0 supports:
- **Always-Open Idea Backlog:** A dedicated channel (e.g., Slack, Teams) integrated via ChatOps where any team member can submit an idea. Ideas can be upvoted by the community.
- **Sandbox PDP:** A lightweight, unstructured PDP type (`@type: "SandboxPDP"`) for exploring speculative ideas without the full process overhead. Successful sandbox experiments can be formally promoted to an `AOS-Lite` or `AOS-Standard` project.

#### F.3 Silent Failure Prevention (Critique 40)
To prevent silent failures from model/engine version mismatches, the CI/CD pipeline for any AOS implementation MUST include:
- **Contract Testing:** Automatically generate and run test cases from BPMN/DMN definitions against a staging engine before promotion.
- **Compatibility Hash:** The build process MUST generate a compatibility hash of all process and decision models. This hash is stored in the PDP's `execution_model`. The runtime engine MUST validate this hash on instantiation and alert on any mismatch.
