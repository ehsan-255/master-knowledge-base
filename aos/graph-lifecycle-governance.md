# Knowledge Graph Lifecycle & Governance Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Applies to:** AOS v4.0

## 1. The Scalability Challenge

An "infinite retention" policy for the knowledge graph, combined with the exponential data growth from fractal recursion, is unsustainable and will lead to crippling performance degradation and administrative overhead.

This policy addresses Critique #19 (Scalability Issues) by establishing a formal data lifecycle to manage graph growth intelligently, ensuring the system remains performant and cost-effective at scale.

## 2. Bounded Fractal Recursion

To prevent the uncontrolled, exponential growth of Project Digital Twins (PDPs), fractal decomposition is bounded:

*   **`max_depth` Parameter:** Decomposition has an adaptive `max_depth` parameter. The depth is determined during the "Triage & Scoping" phase based on project complexity and risk.
*   **Atomic Work Items:** Below this maximum depth, tasks are managed as atomic work items within the parent's execution plan (e.g., stories in a backlog), not as new, full-fledged PDPs.

## 3. Tiered Data Lifecycle Policy

The Knowledge Graph implements a `GraphLifecyclePolicy` with tiered data storage to manage cost and performance.

*   **Hot Tier (Real-time Graph):** Contains all data for active projects. This tier is optimized for high-performance queries and real-time inference.
*   **Warm Tier (Summarized Archive):** When a project is closed, a "PDP Summary" node is created. This node retains the core definitions, key decisions, and learned patterns, while the granular, transactional event logs are moved to the cold tier. The summary nodes remain in a queryable state for historical analysis.
*   **Cold Tier (Deep Archive):** Detailed event logs, verbose telemetry, and intermediate artifacts from closed projects are compressed and moved to a low-cost, archival object storage solution (e.g., AWS Glacier, Azure Blob Archive).

## 4. Graph Performance and Federation

To ensure the Hot Tier remains performant as the organization scales, the following strategies are employed:

*   **Intelligent Indexing:** A continuous process analyzes query patterns and dynamically updates graph indexes to optimize performance.
*   **Federated Architecture:** For very large-scale deployments, the Knowledge Graph can be sharded (e.g., by business domain) into a federated or distributed architecture, allowing for horizontal scaling.
