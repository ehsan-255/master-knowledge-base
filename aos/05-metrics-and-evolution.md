## Part V: Antifragile Metrics & Evolution

> **Scope Note:** The KPIs and metrics defined in this document focus on **project, business, and organizational evolution**. They are used to measure strategic outcomes and team well-being. For technical, component-level observability standards (e.g., traces, RED metrics, structured logs), refer to the **[AOS Observability, Compliance, and Enforcement](./observability-and-compliance.md)** specification.

### 6.0 Human-Centric Metrics and Well-being

> Implements solutions for Critique 46 (Dehumanization) and Critique 45 (Algorithmic Homogenization):
> - Telemetry is team-owned and aggregated above the individual level by default; opt-in is required for granular data.
> - Human-centric metrics are tracked to ensure psychological safety and well-being.

```yaml
human_centric_metrics:
  psychological_safety_index:
    description: "Team-reported sense of safety, trust, and openness."
    target: "> 0.8"
    measurement: "Confidential team surveys, aggregated and anonymized."
    value_anchor: "team_wellbeing"
    null_hypothesis: "No improvement in psychological safety."
    confidence_level_required: 0.9
    confidence_interval: "[0.75, 0.85]"
  burnout_risk:
    description: "Risk of team burnout based on workload and survey data."
    target: "< 0.2"
    measurement: "Survey and workload analysis."
    value_anchor: "sustainable_performance"
    null_hypothesis: "No reduction in burnout risk."
    confidence_level_required: 0.9
    confidence_interval: "[0.15, 0.25]"
```

> All telemetry is team-owned and primarily used for self-improvement. Data is aggregated above the individual level by default.

### 6.1 Antifragile KPIs (Externally Validated, Metric Pairs, and Composite Indices)

> Implements solutions for Critique 2 (Circular Reasoning) and Critique 16 (Quantifiable Abstractions):
> - Each KPI is paired with a balancing metric (metric pair) or is a composite index.
> - All KPIs are linked to externally validated value anchors (business KPIs).
> - Each hypothesis includes a null hypothesis and required confidence level.

| Objective | Primary Metric | Counter-Metric | Composite Index |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Innovation vs Stability | `innovation_index` | `stability_index` | `composite_innovation_score` (weighted 0.6 / 0.4) |
| Adaptability vs Cost | `adaptation_effectiveness` | `change_cost_index` | `adaptive_efficiency` |

## Adaptation Trigger Catalogue  <!-- C-15 -->

| Trigger ID | KPI | Threshold | Re-entry Phase |
|------------|-----|-----------|---------------|
| TRG-1 | innovation_index drop | â‰¥ 0.2 below baseline | DESIGN |
| TRG-2 | volatility_class = Harmful | any | DIAGNOSE |
| TRG-3 | stability_index < 0.4 | persistent 2 sprints | DELIVER |

> All metrics must be externally validated, linked to value anchors, and include null hypotheses and confidence levels. Composite indices and metric pairs are used to prevent gaming and ensure scientific rigor.
