## The Antifragile OS (AOS) v4.0

AOS v4.0 is a comprehensive, AI-augmented methodology for navigating complex problem spaces and delivering resilient solutions. It integrates a suite of battle-tested strategic, tactical, and execution frameworks into a single, coherent system.

The core of AOS v4.0 is built upon the **Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) v1.3**, a resilient, modular, and plugin-based system. This architecture replaces the previous monolithic model, enabling true antifragility not just in the projects it manages, but in the OS itself. Methodologies like Wardley Mapping, Theory of Constraints, and Design Thinking are implemented as swappable "Capability Plugins," coordinated by intelligent "Orchestrator Plugins" that manage the 5D Journey. This ensures the system is adaptable, scalable, and not rigidly dependent on any single academic theory.

This document provides an overview of the five core phases of the AOS journey, known as the "5D Journey":

1.  **DEFINE**: Establish the strategic context and value anchors.
2.  **DIAGNOSE**: Assess the problem domain's complexity and identify constraints.
3.  **DESIGN**: Generate and model robust solution options.
4.  **DEVELOP**: Decompose the solution into an actionable, fractal plan.
5.  **DELIVER & LEARN**: Execute the plan, gather telemetry, and learn.

It serves as the entry point for understanding the AOS framework.

## Phase 0: Triage & Scoping

Before starting the 5D Journey, every project enters a triage and scoping phase. This determines the required "PDP Depth" and selects the appropriate AOS profile:

- **AOS-Lite:** For small, simple tasks. Uses a simplified, single-file PDP and bypasses heavy analysis. Maps to a minimal HMA deployment.
- **AOS-Standard:** The full framework for significant projects, with all analysis and orchestration steps.
- **AOS-Enterprise:** For large-scale programs, adds portfolio management and advanced governance.

This phase ensures that the process is right-sized for the project's complexity and resources, improving accessibility and reducing cognitive load.

## Supporting Conceptual Documents

The following documents provide detailed policies, charters, and conceptual deep-dives that support the core AOS framework. They are referenced throughout the documentation and provide normative guidance on specific implementation details.

- **[The Citable AI Charter](./citable-ai-charter.md):** Defines the policy for ensuring all AI-generated artifacts are traceable, verifiable, and accountable.
- **[Decomposition and Coupling Policy](./decomposition-and-coupling-policy.md):** Outlines the pragmatic approach to problem decomposition, replacing rigid MECE validation with a "Sufficiently Decoupled" heuristic.
