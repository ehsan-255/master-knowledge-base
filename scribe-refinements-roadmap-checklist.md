## CHECKLIST USAGE PROTOCOL

### **STATUS TRACKING**
- **Update checkboxes** continuously during execution **at all times**
- **Add one-liner notes** *only* for important execution points, decisions, or issues. *NOT REQUIRED; ADD ONLY IF NEEDED*
- **Apply cascading status** to parent branches when items are blocked or in progress
- **Reference main roadmap** for detailed instructions and context

### **NOTE MANAGEMENT**
- **NOTES ARE NOT REQUIRED; ADD ONLY FOR VERY IMPORTANT EXECUTION POINTS, DECISIONS, OR ISSUES**
- **Replace 🔤 with a one-liner note *only if needed*, otherwise delete the whole placeholder**
- **Keep notes brief** - maximum 1-2 lines per item
- **Focus on execution highlights** - important decisions, issues, changes, outcomes
- **Use timestamps** when helpful for critical notes
- **Avoid duplicating** information already in progress tracker

### **COORDINATION**
- **This checklist** is for quick status updates and brief notes
- **Progress tracker** is for detailed completion documentation
- **Main roadmap** remains the authoritative source for execution instructions

>**NO OTHER REPORTING, TRACKING, OR DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED FOR A ROADMAP**
