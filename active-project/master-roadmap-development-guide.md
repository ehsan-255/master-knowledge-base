# MASTER ROADMAP DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

>**THIS GUIDE PROVIDES **MANDATORY** METHODOLOGY FOR DEVELOPING COMPREHENSIVE MASTER ROADMAPS THAT SPECIFY THE EXECUTION SEQUENCE FOR ALL PROJECT TASKS**

---

## **OVERVIEW — CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**

**THE MASTER ROADMAP DERIVES FROM THE MASTER ANALYSIS REPORT AND SPECIFIES THE MANDATORY SEQUENCE IN WHICH ALL PROJECT TASKS MUST BE EXECUTED TO ACHIEVE COMPLETION.**

### **FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS**
- **OUTLINES** various high-level steps, each of which **WILL** be treated as an independent job or project requiring its own `analysis-report` and `roadmap`
- **WORK DECOMPOSITION** begins with identifying the largest segments of work and progresses incrementally to smaller, actionable units
- **THE SMALLEST GRANULAR TASK** must be executable within a single sprint and **MUST** follow the format in `active-project/roadmap-template`
- **DECOMPOSITION STRUCTURE**: Uses "sub-levels" (`sl[n]`) for hierarchical task breakdown

---

## **DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY — MANDATORY PROCESS**

### **PHASE 1: ANALYSIS AND PREPARATION**
1. **MASTER ANALYSIS REVIEW**: Thoroughly review the master analysis report
2. **OBJECTIVE DECOMPOSITION**: Break down project objectives into major work streams
3. **DEPENDENCY MAPPING**: Identify all dependencies between work streams
4. **CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS**: Analyze all constraints affecting execution sequence

### **PHASE 2: HIGH-LEVEL DECOMPOSITION**
1. **MAJOR PHASE IDENTIFICATION**: Identify the largest segments of work (PHASES)
2. **PHASE SEQUENCING**: Determine mandatory execution sequence for phases
3. **PHASE DEPENDENCY VALIDATION**: Validate dependencies between phases
4. **PHASE MILESTONE DEFINITION**: Define major milestones and deliverables

### **PHASE 3: INTERMEDIATE DECOMPOSITION**
1. **P1.1 IDENTIFICATION**: Break down phases into manageable P1.1 units
2. **P1.1 SEQUENCING**: Determine execution sequence within each phase
3. **P1.1 DEPENDENCY MAPPING**: Map dependencies between P1.1 units
4. **P1.1 DELIVERABLE DEFINITION**: Define specific deliverables for each P1.1 unit

### **PHASE 4: DETAILED DECOMPOSITION**
1. **P1.1.1 IDENTIFICATION**: Break down P1.1 units into specific P1.1.1 units
2. **P1.1.1.1 DEFINITION**: Further decompose complex units into P1.1.1.1 level
3. **P1.1.1.1.1 SPECIFICATION**: Define atomic P1.1.1.1.1 units for execution
4. **SPRINT ALIGNMENT**: Ensure units align with sprint execution capacity

## **DECOMPOSITION STRATEGY — MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION**

### **DECOMPOSITION LEVELS**

#### **PHASE LEVEL (P1, P2, P3...)**
- **HIGHEST LEVEL** of task decomposition
- **MAJOR WORK STREAMS** that represent significant project segments
- **INDEPENDENT EXECUTION** capability with clear deliverables
- **MILESTONE ALIGNMENT** with major project checkpoints

#### **P1.1 LEVEL (P1.1, P1.2, P1.3...)**
- **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL** of decomposition within phases
- **LOGICAL GROUPINGS** of related work activities
- **SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION** within phase boundaries
- **DELIVERABLE FOCUS** with specific outcomes

#### **P1.1.1 LEVEL (P1.1.1, P1.1.2, P1.1.3...)**
- **DETAILED LEVEL** of work specification
- **SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES** with clear scope and boundaries
- **RESOURCE ASSIGNMENT** capability for team members
- **PROGRESS TRACKING** at granular level

#### **P1.1.1.1 LEVEL (P1.1.1.1, P1.1.1.2...)**
- **GRANULAR LEVEL** for complex breakdown
- **COMPONENT ACTIVITIES** within larger work units
- **SKILL-SPECIFIC** work assignments
- **DETAILED PROGRESS** monitoring capability

#### **P1.1.1.1.1 LEVEL (P1.1.1.1.1, P1.1.1.1.2...)**
- **ATOMIC LEVEL** of work specification
- **SINGLE EXECUTION UNIT** that cannot be further decomposed
- **IMMEDIATE EXECUTION** capability within single work session
- **BINARY COMPLETION** status (done or not done)

---

## **SUB-LEVEL MANAGEMENT — HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE**

### **SUB-LEVEL DESIGNATION (sl[n])**
- **HIERARCHICAL BREAKDOWN** within each level
- **SEQUENTIAL NUMBERING** for execution order
- **DEPENDENCY TRACKING** between sub-levels
- **PROGRESS MONITORING** at sub-level granularity

### **SUB-LEVEL EXAMPLES**
- **Phase Sub-levels**: P1-sl1, P1-sl2, P1-sl3
- **Step Sub-levels**: P1.1-sl1, P1.1-sl2, P1.1-sl3
- **Task Sub-levels**: P1.1.1-sl1, P1.1.1-sl2, P1.1.1-sl3

## **DECOMPOSITION DECISION MATRIX — MANDATORY ASSESSMENT**

### **HIGH PRECISION PROJECTS**
- **DECOMPOSE TO**: P1.1.1.1.1 level
- **USE WHEN**: Critical systems, regulatory compliance, complex technical work
- **BENEFITS**: Maximum predictability, minimal risk, clear accountability
- **REQUIREMENTS**: Comprehensive exit conditions, mandatory checklists

### **BALANCED PROJECTS**
- **DECOMPOSE TO**: P1.1.1 or P1.1.1.1 level
- **USE WHEN**: Standard development, implementation projects
- **BENEFITS**: Balanced control and flexibility
- **REQUIREMENTS**: Recommended exit conditions, mandatory checklists

### **HIGH FLEXIBILITY PROJECTS**
- **DECOMPOSE TO**: P1.1 level or minimal breakdown
- **USE WHEN**: Research, design, strategic planning, innovation
- **BENEFITS**: Maximum flexibility and creative freedom
- **REQUIREMENTS**: Minimal formal tracking, mandatory checklists

## **EXECUTION SEQUENCE SPECIFICATION — MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS**

### **SEQUENTIAL DEPENDENCIES**
- **HARD DEPENDENCIES**: Tasks that cannot start until predecessors complete
- **SOFT DEPENDENCIES**: Tasks with preferred but not mandatory sequencing
