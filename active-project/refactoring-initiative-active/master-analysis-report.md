## Roadmap: Standards Refactoring

This roadmap outlines the phases, steps, and tasks required to fully refactor the existing standards according to the new architecture and categorization schemes, incorporating all agreed-upon revisions and final clarifications.

### Phase 0: Foundations, Definitions & Initial Tooling (Pre-Refactoring)

**Goal:** Establish all necessary definitions, conventions, foundational metadata structures, and initial automation prototypes before modifying existing content.

*   **Step 0.1: Finalize Naming Conventions & Identifiers**
    *   **Task 0.1.1:** Document the confirmed atomic file naming convention: `{DOMAIN_CODE}-{SUB_DOMAIN_CODE}-{PRIMARY_TOPIC_KEYWORD}-{OPTIONAL_SECONDARY_TOPICS*}.md`.
    *   **Task 0.1.2:** Develop and document the strategy for `PRIMARY_TOPIC_KEYWORD` selection. This includes creating an initial proposal table mapping existing standard concepts (e.g., from `U-ARCH-001`) to their new `PRIMARY_TOPIC_KEYWORD`s, ensuring differentiation for Standard Definition vs. Policy/Guideline files (e.g., `KB-ROOT` for `AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT` and `CS-POLICY-KB-ROOT`).
    *   **Task 0.1.3:** Document the regex for `standard_id` syntax as `^[A-Z]{2}-[A-Z]{2,6}-[A-Z0-9\-]+$` (all-caps, numerals, hyphens; no spaces, no underscores) in `U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001.md`.
    *   **Task 0.1.4:** Document in `U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001.md` that filenames (sans `.md`) SHOULD equal the `standard_id` metadata field.

*   **Step 0.2: Define Controlled Vocabularies & Registries**
    *   **Task 0.2.1:** Create `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/domain_codes.yaml` (or `.md`) defining the `DOMAIN_CODE`s (AS, CS, MT, SF, OM, GM, UA, QM) with their full names and descriptions.
    *   **Task 0.2.2:** Create `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/subdomain_registry.yaml` defining the initial set of `SUB_DOMAIN_CODE`s for each `DOMAIN_CODE`, with descriptions.
    *   **Task 0.2.3:** Update `U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001.md` with the finalized controlled vocabulary for the `info-type` metadata field, referencing the list within the document itself.
    *   **Task 0.2.4:** Update `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/tag-glossary-definition.md` (confirming this new path) with the finalized controlled vocabulary for `status/*` tags, derived from existing content and refined.
    *   **Task 0.2.5:** Update `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/tag-glossary-definition.md` with the finalized controlled vocabulary for `content-type/*` tags, ensuring alignment with `info-type` where appropriate.
    *   **Task 0.2.6:** Define the controlled vocabulary for `Criticality` (e.g., `P0-Critical`, `P1-High`, `P2-Medium`) within `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/tag-glossary-definition.md` (e.g., as `criticality/P0-Critical`) or a dedicated `criticality_levels.yaml` in the registry.
    *   **Task 0.2.7:** Define the controlled vocabulary for `Lifecycle_Gatekeeper` (e.g., `Architect-Review`, `SME-Consensus`, `Automated-Validation`) within `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/tag-glossary-definition.md` (e.g., as `gatekeeper/Architect-Review`) or a dedicated `gatekeepers.yaml` in the registry.
    *   **Task 0.2.8:** Ensure all vocabulary files in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/` are created and populated.

*   **Step 0.3: Finalize Metadata Schema & Core Documentation Updates**
    *   **Task 0.3.1:** Update `U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001.md` (at its current path, to be renamed/moved in Phase 2) to:
        *   Add the new `standard_id` key (placed directly after `title`), specifying its regex (from Task 0.1.3).
        *   Add new keys: `primary_domain`, `sub_domain`, `scope_application`, `criticality`, `lifecycle_gatekeeper`, `impact_areas`, `change_log_url`.
        *   Define the frontmatter key order: `title`, `standard_id`, `aliases`, `tags`, `kb-id`, `info-type`, `primary-topic`, `related-standards`, `version`, `date-created`, `date-modified`, then the seven new extension keys.
        *   Clarify that filename SHOULD equal `standard_id`.
        *   Specify date fields (`date-created`, `date-modified`) MUST use full ISO-8601 date-time with "Z" (e.g., `2025-05-27T15:42:00Z`).
        *   Specify YAML frontmatter encoding: "UTF-8 (no BOM), LF line endings" for all Markdown files.
        *   Specify `change_log_url` can be relative (starting `./`, linter checks existence) or absolute (linter checks basic syntax).
    *   **Task 0.3.2:** Create `/master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` including `standard_id`, all other mandatory frontmatter keys, and ISO-8601 date format placeholders.
    *   **Task 0.3.3:** Update `O-USAGE-LINKS-001.md` (currently a section in `COL-TOOLING-OBSIDIAN.md`, to be extracted in Phase 1) to reflect the canonical link style `[[STANDARD_ID]]` and the transitional policy (Phase 0: `warning` for path-based links from linter).

*   **Step 0.4: Plan Directory Structure**
    *   **Task 0.4.1:** Document the target Layer 1 directory for atomic files as `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/`.
    *   **Task 0.4.2:** Document the target directory for vocabulary manifests as `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/`.
    *   **Task 0.4.3:** Document the target directory for templates as `/master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/` with filenames prefixed `tpl-`.

*   **Step 0.5: Initial Automation Development (Prototypes in Python, located in `/master-knowledge-base/tools/`)**
    *   **Task 0.5.1:** Provide specifications, pseudocode, and Python skeletons for a prototype linter (`/tools/linter/kb_linter.py`) supporting severity levels (`info`, `warning`, `error`). The linter must:
        *   Enforce `standard_id` regex and uniqueness across files in `/standards/src/`.
        *   Check for presence of all mandatory frontmatter keys.
        *   Validate `date-created` and `date-modified` against ISO-8601 format.
        *   Validate values against controlled vocabularies loaded from `/standards/registry/` files.
        *   Check YAML encoding (UTF-8 no BOM, LF line endings).
        *   Check `change_log_url` (existence if relative, basic syntax if absolute).
        *   Issue `warning` for path-based internal links.
    *   **Task 0.5.2:** Provide specifications, pseudocode, and Python skeletons for a prototype `standards_index.json` generator (`/tools/indexer/generate_index.py`). The output `standards_index.json` must:
        *   Include a root-level `"schemaVersion": 1`.
        *   Parse all atomic files in `/standards/src/`.
        *   Extract key metadata: `standard_id`, `title`, `primary_domain`, `sub_domain`, `info-type`, `version`, `status` (from tags), filepath, `date-modified`.
    *   **Task 0.5.3:** Create a formal JSON Schema definition (`/tools/indexer/standards_index.schema.json`) for the structure of `standards_index.json`.
    *   **Task 0.5.4:** (Optional, based on Ehsan's confirmation of CI platform, e.g., GitHub Actions) Provide specifications for a basic CI workflow (`.github/workflows/standards_check.yml`) to run the linter and index generator, emitting a Markdown summary report of findings (counts of errors/warnings, index build status).

*   **Exit Criteria for Phase 0:**
    *   All foundational documents (`U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001.md` (updated), `O-USAGE-LINKS-001.md` (updated section placeholder), `tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md`, vocabulary manifests in `/standards/registry/`) are created/updated and committed.
    *   Prototype linter (specs/pseudocode/skeletons) defined, capable of validating `standard_id` (syntax, uniqueness) and other core checks on test files; issues `warning` for path-based links.
    *   Prototype `standards_index.json` generator (specs/pseudocode/skeletons) defined, including `schemaVersion` and its own JSON schema.
    *   (If CI confirmed) CI workflow (specs) defined to emit a summary report.

### Phase 1: Atomic Decomposition, Splitting & Metadata Enrichment

**Goal:** Convert existing "collection" based standards into initial atomic "Standard Definition" AND "Policy/Guideline" files, applying new naming and enriched metadata from the outset.

*   **Step 1.1: Process `master-knowledge-base/standards/COL-ARCH-UNIVERSAL.md`**
    *   **Task 1.1.1:** For each standard concept (U-ARCH-001, U-ARCH-002, U-STRUC-001, U-STRUC-002, U-DETAIL-LEVEL-001, U-FORMAT-NAMING-001) within `COL-ARCH-UNIVERSAL.md`:
        *   Analyze its content to identify "HOW/WHERE" (Standard Definition) vs. "WHAT/WHEN/WHY" (Policy/Guideline) aspects.
        *   Create one or two new atomic Markdown files in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` based on the analysis (e.g., for U-ARCH-001, create `AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT.md` and potentially `CS-POLICY-KB-ROOT.md`).
        *   Apply the new naming convention. Assign a unique `standard_id` (matching filename, adhering to regex from Task 0.1.3) to each new file.
        *   Populate all frontmatter fields for each new file using `tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` as a base (including ISO-8601 dates, correct `primary_domain`, `sub_domain`, `scope_application`, `criticality`, `lifecycle_gatekeeper`, `impact_areas`, `change_log_url`).
        *   Set `info-type` to `standard-definition` or `policy-document` as appropriate.
        *   Migrate the relevant content (rule statements, examples, cross-references) into the appropriate new file(s).
        *   Update `related-standards` in the frontmatter of the new Standard Definition and Policy Document to link to each other if split from a single concept.
    *   **Task 1.1.2:** Mark `COL-ARCH-UNIVERSAL.md` for future deprecation by adding a deprecation notice at the top of the file.

*   **Step 1.2: Process `master-knowledge-base/standards/COL-CONTENT-UNIVERSAL.md`**
    *   **Task 1.2.1:** Repeat the sub-tasks from Task 1.1.1 for each standard concept (U-SCHEMA-METHOD-001, U-SCHEMA-CONCEPT-001, U-TONE-LANG-001, U-SCOPE-INCLUDE-001, U-SCOPE-EXCLUDE-001, U-ABSTR-DIGITAL-001) within `COL-CONTENT-UNIVERSAL.md`.
    *   **Task 1.2.2:** Mark `COL-CONTENT-UNIVERSAL.md` for future deprecation.

*   **Step 1.3: Process `master-knowledge-base/standards/COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md`**
    *   **Task 1.3.1:** Repeat Task 1.1.1 for each standard concept (U-VERSIONING-001, U-GOVERNANCE-001, U-DEPRECATION-001, U-ONBOARDING-001, U-GLOSSARY-001, U-TEMPLATES-DIR-001, U-FILEHYGIENE-001) within `COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md`. Note: `U-ONBOARDING-001` will have `info-type: guide-document`.
    *   **Task 1.3.2:** Mark `COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md` for future deprecation.

*   **Step 1.4: Process `master-knowledge-base/standards/COL-LINKING-UNIVERSAL.md`**
    *   **Task 1.4.1:** Repeat Task 1.1.1 for each standard concept (U-INTERLINK-001, U-TAG-001, U-CITE-001, U-MODULAR-001, U-ACCESSIBILITY-001, U-ASSETS-001) within `COL-LINKING-UNIVERSAL.md`.
    *   **Task 1.4.2:** Mark `COL-LINKING-UNIVERSAL.md` for future deprecation.

*   **Step 1.5: Process `master-knowledge-base/standards/COL-SYNTAX-MARKDOWN.md`**
    *   **Task 1.5.1:** Repeat Task 1.1.1 for each standard concept (M-SYNTAX-YAML-001, M-SYNTAX-HEADINGS-001, etc.) within `COL-SYNTAX-MARKDOWN.md`.
    *   **Task 1.5.2:** Mark `COL-SYNTAX-MARKDOWN.md` for future deprecation.

*   **Step 1.6: Process `master-knowledge-base/standards/COL-TOOLING-OBSIDIAN.md`**
    *   **Task 1.6.1:** Repeat Task 1.1.1 for each standard concept (O-USAGE-LINKS-001, O-USAGE-TAGS-001, O-USAGE-FOLDERS-NOTES-001, O-USAGE-TOC-MANDATE-001, O-USAGE-TRANSCLUSION-001, O-USAGE-CALLOUTS-001, O-USAGE-TOC-PLUGIN-001) within `COL-TOOLING-OBSIDIAN.md`. This includes extracting `O-USAGE-LINKS-001` into its own atomic file.
    *   **Task 1.6.2:** Mark `COL-TOOLING-OBSIDIAN.md` for future deprecation.

*   **Step 1.7: Implement Specific Merging/Refactoring Decisions (ensuring Standard/Policy split)**
    *   **Task 1.7.1 (Internal Linking):** Create `/standards/src/SF-LINKS-INTERNAL-SYNTAX.md` (`info-type: standard-definition`) and `/standards/src/CS-LINKING-INTERNAL-POLICY.md` (`info-type: policy-document`), populating with full metadata and relevant content from original M-SYNTAX-LINKS-001 and O-USAGE-LINKS-001.
    *   **Task 1.7.2 (ToC):** Create `/standards/src/SF-TOC-STRUCTURE.md` (Standard Def) and `/standards/src/CS-TOC-MANDATE.md` (Policy), populating from U-STRUC-002 and O-USAGE-TOC-MANDATE-001/PLUGIN-001. Remove ToC mandate for atomic standard files.
    *   **Task 1.7.3 (Part Overview/Folder Notes):** Ensure rules for `_overview.md` structure are in an appropriate AS standard (e.g., `AS-STRUCTURE-PART-OVERVIEW.md`) and its mandate in a CS policy (e.g., `CS-POLICY-PART-OVERVIEW.md`). Remove all mentions of Obsidian folder note plugins from standards/policies.
    *   **Task 1.7.4 (Transclusion):** Create `/standards/src/SF-TRANSCLUSION-SYNTAX.md` (Standard Def) and `/standards/src/CS-MODULARITY-TRANSCLUSION-POLICY.md` (Policy) from U-MODULAR-001 and O-USAGE-TRANSCLUSION-001.
    *   **Task 1.7.5 (Callouts):** Create `/standards/src/SF-CALLOUTS-SYNTAX.md` (Standard Def, promoting O-USAGE-CALLOUTS-001) and `/standards/src/CS-ADMONITIONS-POLICY.md` (Policy).
    *   **Task 1.7.6 (Tagging):** Create `/standards/src/MT-TAGS-IMPLEMENTATION.md` (Standard Def) and `/standards/src/MT-TAGGING-STRATEGY-POLICY.md` (Policy) from U-TAG-001.
    *   **Task 1.7.7 (Conditional Text):** Ensure `SF-CALLOUTS-SYNTAX.md` lists `IF` as a type. Create `/standards/src/SF-CONDITIONAL-SYNTAX-ATTRIBUTES.md` (Standard Def for `attribute=value` syntax) and `/standards/src/CS-CONTENT-PROFILING-POLICY.md` (Policy, replacing `U-PROFILING-ATTRIBUTES-001.md`).

*   **Step 1.8: Refactor Guide Documents**
    *   **Task 1.8.1:** For `master-knowledge-base/standards/GUIDE-KB-USAGE-AND-STANDARDS.md`:
        *   Rename to `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.md`.
        *   Assign a unique `standard_id` (e.g., `GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE`).
        *   Populate its full frontmatter, ensuring `info-type: guide-document`.
        *   Thoroughly revise its content to reflect the new atomic structure, the Standard/Policy split, and link to the new atomic files using `[[STANDARD_ID]]` style.
    *   **Task 1.8.2:** For `master-knowledge-base/standards/GUIDE-TASK-BASED.md`:
        *   Rename to `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.md`.
        *   Assign a unique `standard_id` (e.g., `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK`).
        *   Populate its full frontmatter, ensuring `info-type: guide-document`.
        *   Thoroughly revise its content to link to the new atomic files using `[[STANDARD_ID]]` style.

*   **Exit Criteria for Phase 1:**
    *   All standards from original collection files are decomposed into atomic Standard Definition and/or Policy/Guideline files in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/`.
    *   All new atomic files have complete and valid frontmatter (ISO dates, `standard_id`, etc.).
    *   Linter (prototype) now configured to `error` on path-based internal links, and passes on all files in `/standards/src/`.
    *   `standards_index.json` (prototype) builds successfully and includes all new atomic files.
    *   Guide documents (`GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.md`, `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.md`) are refactored.
    *   Original collection files are marked with deprecation notices.
    *   CI (or script run) emits a summary report.

### Phase 2: Governance Review of Standard/Policy Boundary & Standalone/Utility Document Refactoring

**Goal:** Ensure consistent application of Standard/Policy separation. Refactor all remaining standalone and utility standards-related documents.

*   **Step 2.1: Review Atomic Files from Phase 1 for Standard/Policy Separation**
    *   **Task 2.1.1:** Systematically review each pair of (or standalone) Standard Definition and Policy/Guideline files created in Phase 1.
    *   **Task 2.1.2:** Verify that content is correctly allocated (HOW/WHERE in Standard Definition vs. WHAT/WHEN/WHY in Policy/Guideline).
    *   **Task 2.1.3:** Identify any ambiguities or overlaps. Refine content by moving text, merging, or further splitting files if necessary to ensure clean separation. Update `standard_id`s and filenames if splits occur.
    *   **Task 2.1.4:** Ensure `related-standards` links between corresponding Standard Definition/Policy files are accurate and use `[[STANDARD_ID]]` style.

*   **Step 2.2: Refactor Existing Standalone Standard Files**
    *   **Task 2.2.1:** For each standalone standard file (e.g., `U-KEYREF-SYNTAX-001.md`, `LLM-AUTOMATION-IO-SCHEMA-001.md`, `M-CONDITIONAL-TEXT-SYNTAX-001.md` (if not fully superseded by Task 1.7.7), `M-SYNTAX-TODO-001.md`, `U-ARCH-003-Directory-Structure-Source-Render.md`, `U-KEYREF-MANAGEMENT-001.md`, `U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001.md`, `U-METADATA-SLUG-KEY-001.md` (placeholder), `U-PUBLISHING-PIPELINE-OVERVIEW-001.md`, `U-RELTABLE-DEFINITION-001.md`, `U-SCHEMA-REFERENCE-001.md`, `U-SCHEMA-TASK-001.md`, `U-VALIDATION-METADATA-001.md`):
        *   Move to `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/`.
        *   Apply the new naming convention and assign a unique `standard_id`.
        *   Analyze and split into "Standard Definition" (HOW/WHERE) and "Policy/Guideline" (WHAT/WHEN/WHY) components if necessary, creating new files in `/standards/src/` with appropriate `standard_id`s and `info-type`.
        *   Enrich metadata to the full set of frontmatter keys for all resulting atomic files.
        *   Ensure all internal links use `[[STANDARD_ID]]` style.

*   **Step 2.3: Refactor Glossary & Definition Files**
    *   **Task 2.3.1 (`master-knowledge-base/standards/GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS.md`):**
        *   Move to `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS.md`.
        *   Assign `standard_id` (e.g., `GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS`).
        *   Populate full frontmatter, `info-type: glossary-document`.
        *   Review and update terms based on new architecture; ensure links use `[[STANDARD_ID]]`.
    *   **Task 2.3.2 (`master-knowledge-base/tag-glossary-definition.md`):**
        *   Move to `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/tag-glossary-definition.md` (as per Phase 0).
        *   Assign `standard_id` (e.g., `MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY`).
        *   Populate full frontmatter, `info-type: tag-glossary-document`.
        *   Verify its content aligns with refactored tagging standards.
    *   **Task 2.3.3 (`master-knowledge-base/_key_definitions.md`):**
        *   Move to `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/UA-KEYDEFS-GLOBAL.md` (or keep as `_key_definitions.md` in root if scripts rely on fixed path, but assign `standard_id` like `UA-KEYDEFS-GLOBAL`).
        *   Populate full frontmatter, `info-type: key-definition-set`.
    *   **Task 2.3.4 (`master-knowledge-base/standards/_kb_definition.md` for Standards KB):**
        *   Move to `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB.md`.
        *   Assign `standard_id` (e.g., `AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB`).
        *   Populate full frontmatter, `info-type: kb-definition-map`.
        *   Update its `parts:` structure to reference new atomic `[[STANDARD_ID]]`s or planned derived collection views.

*   **Step 2.4: Refactor Root & Navigational Files**
    *   **Task 2.4.1 (`master-knowledge-base/standards/root.md`):**
        *   Move to `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md`.
        *   Assign `standard_id` (e.g., `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB`).
        *   Populate full frontmatter.
        *   Completely overhaul its Table of Contents to link to new atomic `[[STANDARD_ID]]`s or (conceptually) to where derived collection views will be.
    *   **Task 2.4.2 (`master-knowledge-base/kb-directory.md`):**
        *   Move to `/master-knowledge-base/src/AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md` (or similar top-level src if it's truly global).
        *   Assign `standard_id` (e.g., `AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER`).
        *   Populate full frontmatter.
        *   Update links to use `[[STANDARD_ID]]` if it references specific standards documents.

*   **Exit Criteria for Phase 2:**
    *   All atomic files from Phase 1 reviewed and refined for correct Standard/Policy separation.
    *   All standalone standards, glossaries, definition files, root/navigational files are refactored into `/standards/src/` (or other designated `src` locations), with new naming, `standard_id`, and full metadata.
    *   Linter passes on all files in `/standards/src/` (and other `src` locations).
    *   `standards_index.json` builds successfully and includes all refactored files.
    *   CI (or script run) emits a summary report.

### Phase 3: Template Finalization & Link Style Enforcement

**Goal:** Finalize templates and ensure all internal links strictly use the `[[STANDARD_ID]]` convention.

*   **Step 3.1: Finalize Template Files**
    *   **Task 3.1.1:** For all template files in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/` (e.g., `tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md`, `tpl-standard-definition.md`, `tpl-policy-document.md`, `tpl-chapter.md`, etc.):
        *   Ensure their frontmatter placeholders include `standard_id` and all other new canonical keys.
        *   Ensure any example internal links use `[[PLACEHOLDER_STANDARD_ID]]` format.
    *   **Task 3.1.2:** Create a `README.md` within `/master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/` explaining the purpose of each template and when to use it.

*   **Step 3.2: Enforce `[[STANDARD_ID]]` Link Style Across All Refactored Content**
    *   **Task 3.2.1:** Perform a final verification scan of all Markdown files within `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` (and any other `src` directories containing refactored content).
    *   **Task 3.2.2:** Confirm the linter correctly identifies and errors on any remaining path-based internal links. Manually correct any stragglers.

*   **Exit Criteria for Phase 3:**
    *   All templates in `/standards/templates/` are finalized and documented with a README.
    *   All internal links within all refactored source Markdown files strictly use the `[[STANDARD_ID]]` format.
    *   Linter strictly enforces `[[STANDARD_ID]]` links and passes on all refactored source files.
    *   `standards_index.json` (with `schemaVersion`) is stable and reliably maps `standard_id`s to their respective filepaths.
    *   CI (or script run) emits a summary report.

### Phase 4: Design & Implementation of Derived Views & Production Automation

**Goal:** Realize the "Multi-View" aspect by designing and implementing generation of derived collections and production-ready automation tools.

*   **Step 4.1: Design and Implement Derived "Collection" View Generation**
    *   **Task 4.1.1:** Finalize the logic for generating views equivalent to the original "Collection" documents (e.g., a "Universal Architecture Collection"). This includes defining criteria for standard inclusion (e.g., based on `primary_domain` and `sub_domain` from `standards_index.json`).
    *   **Task 4.1.2:** Develop/refine Python script(s) (e.g., in `/tools/builder/`) to generate these derived views.
        *   Scripts will read `standards_index.json` to find relevant source files.
        *   Content from source files will be transcluded or concatenated into the derived view.
        *   Generated ToCs within these views will link to sections of aggregated content.
        *   Output to a `.gitignore`d directory (e.g., `/dist/collections/` or `/site/collections/`).
        *   Internal links within transcluded content (`[[STANDARD_ID]]`) should resolve to anchors within the same collection view if the target is part of the collection, or to links to other collection views/atomic files if external to the current collection.

*   **Step 4.2: Productionize `standards_index.json` Generation**
    *   **Task 4.2.1:** Ensure the `/tools/indexer/generate_index.py` script is robust, handles all edge cases, and its output `standards_index.json` conforms to `/tools/indexer/standards_index.schema.json`.
    *   **Task 4.2.2:** Ensure `schemaVersion` in `standards_index.json` is correctly managed.

*   **Step 4.3: Productionize Metadata Validation Automation (Linter)**
    *   **Task 4.3.1:** Ensure the `/tools/linter/kb_linter.py` script is robust, covers all validation rules from `U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001.md` and `U-VALIDATION-METADATA-001.md` (once refactored), and uses severity levels effectively.
    *   **Task 4.3.2:** Integrate the linter into the CI/CD pipeline (if established) to run on every commit/PR, blocking merges on `error` severity.

*   **Exit Criteria for Phase 4:**
    *   Scripts for generating derived collection views are functional and produce human-readable, navigable outputs.
    *   `standards_index.json` generation is production-ready and its schema is validated.
    *   Metadata linter is production-ready and integrated (or runnable as a standalone check).
    *   Generated collection views are confirmed to be excluded from version control.
    *   CI (or script run) emits a summary report including counts of atoms/policies and status of derived view generation.

### Phase 5: Final Validation, Review & Documentation

**Goal:** Ensure the entire refactored system is correct, complete, documented, and meets all architectural goals.

*   **Step 5.1: Full System Validation**
    *   **Task 5.1.1:** Perform a comprehensive validation pass on all source files in `/standards/src/` using the production linter.
    *   **Task 5.1.2:** Generate all derived views and meticulously validate their content, structure, and link integrity (both internal to the view and external).
    *   **Task 5.1.3:** Test key navigational pathways in the generated derived views to ensure usability.

*   **Step 5.2: Final Peer Review & System Documentation**
    *   **Task 5.2.1:** Conduct a final peer review of the. Overall system: source structure in `/standards/src/`, generated derived views, and automation scripts in `/tools/`.
    *   **Task 5.2.2:** Create/update documentation for the development and maintenance workflow:
        *   How to add or update an atomic standard/policy.
        *   How to run the linter and indexer locally.
        *   How to regenerate derived views.
        *   Overview of the CI process (if applicable).
    *   **Task 5.2.3:** Prepare an annotated changelog Pull Request summarizing the entire refactoring effort for team review and merge into the main branch.

*   **Step 5.3: Iteration & Refinement Based on Final Review**
    *   **Task 5.3.1:** Address any critical issues identified during the final validation and peer review.
    *   **Task 5.3.2:** Incorporate feedback into documentation and scripts.

*   **Exit Criteria for Phase 5:**
    *   All source files pass linting with no errors.
    *   All defined derived views generate correctly and are validated.
    *   All process and system documentation is complete and accurate.
    *   Team review of the refactoring PR is completed, and changes are merged.
    *   Final CI (or script run) report indicates full system health and successful build.

### Overall Progress Summary

The project has successfully transitioned from monolithic collections to an atomic structure for standards. Phase 0 (Foundations & Definitions) is largely complete, with core conventions and registries established. The structural decomposition of old standards (Phases 1 & 2) is well advanced, with most legacy concepts mapped to new atomic files. Key automation tools (linter, indexer, collection builder) have been implemented with core logic and are beyond mere skeletons, though full productionizing (CI integration, comprehensive error handling) remains.

The most critical remaining task is the **systematic enrichment of YAML frontmatter** for all newly created or refactored *active* atomic standard documents in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` to fully comply with the new `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md` schema. A thorough audit and update of `status: deprecated` for all superseded legacy files is also required.

Detailed progress, including specific file refactoring logs, can be found in `master-knowledge-base/note.md` (e.g., entries for 2025-05-29).

### Phase-by-Phase Progress Report

*   **Phase 0: Foundations, Definitions & Initial Tooling**
    *   **Status:** Substantially Complete.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   **Naming Conventions & Identifiers (Step 0.1):** Atomic file naming convention defined. The `PRIMARY_TOPIC_KEYWORD` component of `standard_id`s has been algorithmically derived using `derive_primary_keyword.py`, with results in `drafts/primary-keyword-mapping.csv` showing zero raw collisions; this component is now locked in. The `standard_id` regex and filename/`standard_id` equivalence rule are documented in `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md`.
        *   **Controlled Vocabularies & Registries (Step 0.2):** Core registry files (e.g., `domain_codes.yaml`, `subdomain_registry.yaml`, `info_types.txt`, `criticality_levels.yaml`, `lifecycle_gatekeepers.yaml`, `tag_categories.txt`) are established in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/`. `tag-glossary-definition.md` has been updated and moved to this registry.
        *   **Metadata Schema & Core Docs (Step 0.3):** `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md` defines the new comprehensive frontmatter schema. `tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` (in `/standards/templates/`) is updated. `SF-LINKS-INTERNAL-SYNTAX.md` defines the `[[STANDARD_ID]]` link style with a transitional policy for path-based links (Phase 0: warning).
        *   **Directory Structure (Step 0.4):** The `/standards/src/`, `/standards/registry/`, and `/standards/templates/` structure is defined and populated.
        *   **Initial Automation Development (Step 0.5):**
            *   `kb_linter.py`: Implemented with core logic for many checks (frontmatter, file hygiene, key validation, link styles, vocab loading from registries). Supports severity levels.
            *   `generate_index.py`: Implemented with core logic for metadata extraction and `standards_index.json` generation (including `schemaVersion`).
            *   `standards_index.schema.json`: Schema for the index is defined.
            *   `validate_registry.py`: Implemented for validating registry files.
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 0:**
        *   Full testing and refinement of linter and indexer scripts to ensure robustness.
        *   (Optional) CI workflow specification/implementation.

*   **Phase 1: Atomic Decomposition, Splitting & Metadata Enrichment**
    *   **Status:** Structural decomposition largely complete. Metadata enrichment for *active* files and comprehensive deprecation marking for *legacy* files are the major outstanding parts.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   **Processing Collection Files (Steps 1.1-1.6):** All old `COL-*.md` files reviewed. Their concepts mapped to atomic standards in `/standards/src/`. Collection files marked as deprecated.
        *   **Specific Merging/Refactoring (Step 1.7):** Key conceptual merges (linking, ToC, callouts, tagging, etc.) addressed by creating/verifying generalized atomic standards.
        *   **Refactor Guide Documents (Step 1.8):** `GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.md` and `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.md` created in `/standards/src/` and refactored.
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 1:**
        *   **Systematic Metadata Enrichment:** All *active* atomic files in `/standards/src/` require their frontmatter to be updated to the full new schema in `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md`. (Note: Deprecated legacy files in their original locations will intentionally remain on the old frontmatter schema, only updated with `status: deprecated` and a deprecation notice).
        *   **Audit & Update Legacy File Statuses:** Systematically ensure every superseded `COL-*.md`, `U-*.md`, and `M-*.md` file in the old `standards/` directory has `status: deprecated` in its frontmatter and an explicit link to its replacement(s) in `/standards/src/`.
        *   Linter to transition from `warning` to `error` for path-based links upon Phase 1 exit.

*   **Phase 2: Governance Review & Standalone/Utility Document Refactoring**
    *   **Status:** Structural refactoring largely complete. Metadata enrichment for active files and full Standard/Policy review outstanding.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   **Refactor Existing Standalone Standard Files (Step 2.2):** Many old `U-*.md`, `M-*.md` standards processed, either superseded or refactored into new atomic files in `/standards/src/`.
        *   **Refactor Glossary & Definition Files (Step 2.3):** Key files like `GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS.md`, `MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY.md`, `UA-KEYDEFS-GLOBAL.md`, and `AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB.md` created/updated.
        *   **Refactor Root & Navigational Files (Step 2.4):** `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` and `AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md` created.
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 2:**
        *   **Systematic Metadata Enrichment:** As with Phase 1, all *active* files created/refactored in this phase need full frontmatter updates.
        *   **Systematic Governance Review (Step 2.1):** Full review of all Standard Definition vs. Policy Document pairs for correct content allocation.
        *   Populate ToCs in `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` and `AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md`.
        *   Resolve unmapped placeholders (from `note.md`).

*   **Phase 3: Template Finalization & Link Style Enforcement**
    *   **Status:** Partially Started.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   **Template Files (Step 3.1):** `tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` is updated and correctly located in `/standards/templates/`. `/standards/templates/README.md` created. (Note: Older templates in the root `/templates/` directory are pending cleanup/removal).
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 3:**
        *   Create `tpl-standard-definition.md` and `tpl-policy-document.md` in `/standards/templates/`.
        *   Systematic enforcement of `[[STANDARD_ID]]` link style across all documents.

*   **Phase 4: Design & Implementation of Derived Views & Production Automation**
    *   **Status:** Core logic implemented for key tools.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   **Derived "Collection" View Generation (Step 4.1):** `generate_collections.py` implemented with core logic for filtering, content aggregation, ToC generation, and advanced link resolution. `collection_definitions.yaml` example exists.
        *   **Indexer (Step 4.2):** `generate_index.py` implemented with core functionality.
        *   **Linter (Step 4.3):** `kb_linter.py` implemented with core functionality and extended checks.
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 4:**
        *   Full productionizing (robust error handling, comprehensive testing) of `generate_collections.py`, `generate_index.py`, and `kb_linter.py`.
        *   CI/CD integration.

*   **Phase 5: Final Validation, Review & Documentation**
    *   **Status:** Planning Complete.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   Detailed plans for "Full System Validation" and "Final Peer Review & System Documentation" drafted (in `note.md`).
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 5:**
        *   Execution of all validation, review, and documentation tasks post-tool productionizing and content enrichment.

### Quality Assessment

*   **Standards Refactoring (Content & Structure):**
    *   **Positive:** Excellent progress in atomic structuring, `standard_id` system, naming conventions, deprecation of collections, Standard/Policy conceptual split, and registry establishment. The `derive_primary_keyword.py` script has successfully confirmed the `PRIMARY_TOPIC_KEYWORD` strategy, which is a key component of `standard_id`s.
    *   **Area for Improvement:**
        1.  **Metadata Enrichment:** The highest priority is the systematic update of YAML frontmatter for all *active* atomic files in `/standards/src/` to the new schema. (Deprecated legacy files will retain old frontmatter).
        2.  **Standard/Policy Review:** A systematic review of all Standard Definition vs. Policy Document pairs is needed.
        3.  **Clarify `PRIMARY_TOPIC_KEYWORD` vs. `primary-topic` Field:** The `derive_primary_keyword.py` script produces the keyword component for `standard_id` (e.g., `KB-ROOT`). The frontmatter field `primary-topic:` remains a distinct, human-authored descriptive phrase (e.g., "Knowledge Base Root Structure"). This distinction should be clear in relevant documentation.

*   **Templates:**
    *   **Positive:** `tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` is updated and correctly located in `/standards/templates/`. README created.
    *   **Area for Improvement:** Creation of `tpl-standard-definition.md` and `tpl-policy-document.md`. Cleanup of legacy templates from the root `/templates/` directory.

*   **Tools and Scripts:**
    *   **Positive:** The Python scripts (`derive_primary_keyword.py`, `kb_linter.py`, `generate_index.py`, `generate_collections.py`, `validate_registry.py`) are implemented with significant core logic, well beyond initial skeletons.
    *   **Area for Improvement:** These tools require final productionizing: comprehensive error handling, full implementation of all specified features (e.g., dynamic loading of *all* vocabularies from registry files for the linter), and thorough testing.

### Key Remaining Tasks & Recommendations

1.  **Systematic Frontmatter Enrichment:** Update YAML frontmatter for ALL *active* atomic files in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` per `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md`.
2.  **Audit & Update Legacy File Statuses:** Ensure every superseded `COL-*.md`, `U-*.md`, and `M-*.md` file has `status: deprecated` and a link to its replacement.
3.  **Full Standard/Policy Content Review:** Systematically review all atomic standards for correct HOW/WHERE vs. WHAT/WHEN/WHY content allocation.
4.  **Registry Completeness & Linter Vocabulary Alignment:** Validate and finalize all registry files in `/standards/registry/`. Ensure the linter loads and uses these for comprehensive vocabulary checks.
5.  **Tool Productionizing & Linter Findings Resolution:** Fully implement, test, and make robust the linter, indexer, and collection builder. Address critical warnings/errors reported by the current linter.
6.  **Template Creation:** Develop `tpl-standard-definition.md` and `tpl-policy-document.md` in `/standards/templates/`.
7.  **Link Style Enforcement:** Systematically update all internal links to `[[STANDARD_ID]]` style.
8.  **Resolve Unmapped Placeholders:** Investigate and fix placeholder links.
9.  **Populate Navigational Files:** Fully populate ToCs in `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` and `AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md`.
10. **CI/CD Integration:** Implement CI/CD workflows.
11. **Final System Validation & Documentation:** Execute Phase 5 tasks.

### Conclusion

The refactoring project is well-positioned. The foundational architecture is solid, and key tooling has seen significant development. Addressing the metadata enrichment for active files and systematically auditing legacy file statuses are the most pressing next steps. Completing the productionizing of tools and acting on their findings will then pave the way for final validation and the realization of a robust, maintainable standards ecosystem. The detailed logs in `master-knowledge-base/note.md` provide excellent traceability for the work completed.
