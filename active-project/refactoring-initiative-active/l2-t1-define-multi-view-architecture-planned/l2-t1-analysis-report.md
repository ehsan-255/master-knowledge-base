## Summary

The **Single-Source / Multi-View Standards Architecture** is a model for managing and publishing sets of operational or technical standards. It establishes **atomic, individual rule documents** as the canonical source of truth, each with its own distinct metadata and lifecycle. Automated build processes then generate various **derived views** from this atomic source, including aggregated "collection" documents optimized for human readability and contextual understanding, alongside other machine-processable outputs (e.g., indexes, semantic data exports).

This architecture ensures that automation, semantic processing, and LLM interactions can operate on precise, granular, and individually versioned rule documents, while human users benefit from curated, easy-to-navigate aggregated views.

## Defining the Single-Source / Multi-View Standards Architecture

### 1. Core Principle

The foundational principle of this architecture is the separation of the **canonical source of truth** from its **presentation or delivery views**. The canonical source is optimized for precision, machine-processability, and granular management, while the delivery views are optimized for specific consumer needs (e.g., human readability, specific toolchain inputs).

### 2. Architectural Layers

The architecture consists of three primary layers:

**Layer 1: Canonical Source (Atomic Standards, Policies, and Guidelines)**

*   **Definition:** This layer comprises the definitive, authoritative versions of all individual rule documents, including "Standard Definitions" (HOW/WHERE), "Policy Documents" (WHAT/WHEN/WHY), and "Guideline Documents." Each is maintained as an atomic file.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Each rule document is maintained as a separate, individual file (e.g., a Markdown file).
    *   Each document possesses its own comprehensive metadata (typically in a frontmatter block), including, but not limited to:
        *   A unique, stable Standard Identifier (ID), using the keyword-based naming convention (e.g., `AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT.md`).
        *   Version information for that specific document.
        *   Lifecycle status (e.g., draft, active, deprecated).
        *   Creation and last modification dates.
        *   Categorization and thematic tags.
        *   Relationships to other rule documents.
        *   The explicit Document Type (e.g., `standard-definition`, `policy-document`, `guideline-document`).
    *   Filenames for these documents SHOULD be stable and directly derivable from their Standard ID (e.g., `{StandardID}.md`).
*   **Purpose:**
    *   To provide a single, unambiguous source for each rule document, encompassing the entire ecosystem of standards, policies, and guidelines.
    *   To enable precise versioning, metadata management, and lifecycle tracking at the individual document level.
    *   To serve as the primary input for all automated processing, validation, semantic analysis (e.g., RDF/OWL generation), and targeted LLM interactions.

**Layer 2: Build & Aggregation Scripts (Automation Engine)**

*   **Definition:** This layer consists of automated scripts and processes that consume the atomic rule documents from Layer 1 and generate various outputs for Layer 3.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Scripts (e.g., Python, Node.js, shell scripts, CI/CD pipeline jobs) are developed to:
        *   Read and parse the atomic rule documents and their metadata.
        *   Aggregate or transclude content from multiple atomic documents into themed "collection" documents based on predefined criteria (e.g., category, tags).
        *   Generate navigational aids such as master indexes, tables of contents for collections, and potentially visual maps of standards.
        *   Export data in other formats (e.g., JSON, XML, RDF triples) for consumption by other systems or for semantic web applications.
        *   Potentially generate embeddings for LLM retrieval augmentation systems.
    *   This process is typically triggered on each change to the canonical source (e.g., on every push to the version control repository).
*   **Purpose:**
    *   To transform the atomic source material into user-friendly and contextually relevant views.
    *   To automate the creation of derived artifacts, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort.
    *   To decouple the source structure from the presentation structure, allowing each to be optimized independently.

**Layer 3: Delivery Views & Consumable Outputs**

*   **Definition:** This layer comprises the various outputs generated by Layer 2, intended for consumption by different audiences (human and machine).
*   **Implementation (Examples):**
    *   **For Human Consumption:**
        *   Thematically organized "collection" documents that aggregate related atomic rule documents into single, scrollable views. These often include generated tables of contents and introductory/concluding text.
        *   Master index documents listing all rule documents with links to their relevant views.
        *   A browsable documentation website (e.g., generated by a static site generator).
    *   **For Machine Consumption (or specific tooling):**
        *   The original atomic files (Layer 1) can also be considered a "delivery view" for tools that require direct access to the canonical source.
        *   Semantic data exports (e.g., RDF/OWL graphs).
        *   JSON/XML representations of the rule documents and their metadata.
        *   Specialized input files for specific validation or LLM fine-tuning pipelines.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   To provide optimized access to the standards knowledge for different users and systems.
    *   To enhance discoverability, readability, and contextual understanding for human users.
    *   To provide structured, validated data for automated systems.

### 3. Key Characteristics & Benefits

*   **Single Source of Truth:** All changes and updates are made *only* to the atomic rule documents in Layer 1. Layer 3 views are read-only build artifacts, ensuring data integrity and preventing conflicting versions.
*   **Granularity & Precision:** The atomic nature of the source allows for precise control, targeting, and analysis of individual rule documents by automated tools and LLMs.
*   **Decoupling:** The authoring/management environment (Layer 1) is decoupled from the consumption environment (Layer 3), allowing each to evolve with different tooling or presentation requirements.
*   **Automation-Centric:** Designed to be driven by automated build processes, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
*   **Flexibility & Extensibility:** New delivery views or output formats can be added by creating new build scripts without altering the canonical source structure.
*   **Improved Governance:** Clear ownership and lifecycle management for each individual rule document. Changes are traceable at a granular level.
*   **Enhanced Human Ergonomics (via Layer 3):** While the source is atomic, humans primarily interact with generated collections that provide better context and reduce cognitive load for browsing.
*   **Support for Semantic Technologies:** The atomic and metadata-rich source is well-suited for transformation into knowledge graphs (RDF/OWL) and for sophisticated semantic querying.

### 4. Implementation Considerations

*   **Metadata Schema:** A well-defined and strictly enforced metadata schema for the atomic rule documents is critical. This schema should include the full set of 17+ fields, including the new "Document Type" field.
*   **Build Tooling:** Selection or development of appropriate build scripts and CI/CD integration is necessary.
*   **Navigational Design:** Careful design of master indexes and the structure of generated collection documents is essential for human usability.
*   **Version Control:** Robust version control (e.g., Git) for Layer 1 (and potentially Layer 3 build artifacts) is assumed.

This architecture provides a scalable and maintainable framework for managing complex sets of standards, balancing the needs of precise automation with human-centric consumption.
