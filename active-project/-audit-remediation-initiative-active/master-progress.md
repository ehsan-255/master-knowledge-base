### 2025-06-19T20:54:00Z
- **L2-SL2 Task Activated**: `l2-sl2-remove-changelog-metadata-active` initiated to remove obsolete changelog metadata from standards frontmatter.

### 2025-06-19T20:55:00Z
- **L2-SL2 Task Completed**: Successfully removed `change_log_url` key from the frontmatter of all 68 standards files where it existed.
- **Summary of L2-SL2 Achievements**:
  - Identified 68 affected files in `standards/src/` containing `change_log_url` key
  - Developed Python removal script (`tools/refactoring-scripts/remove_changelog_metadata.py`) with comprehensive YAML parsing and dry-run capabilities
  - Applied 68 frontmatter modifications successfully, cleanly removing `change_log_url` keys without disturbing other frontmatter structure
  - Verified zero remaining `change_log_url` keys in `standards/src/`
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `tools/refactoring-scripts/remove_changelog_metadata.py` (removal script)
  - 68 standards files with frontmatter cleaned in `standards/src/`
  - `tools/reports/changelog-metadata-removal-20250619-2054.log` (execution log)
- **Exit Criteria Met**: All conditions met - script developed, dry-run tested, live execution successful, and verification confirmed zero remaining instances.
- Status: l2-sl2 ready for completion and archival; project ready to proceed to l2-sl3.

### 2025-06-19T21:00:00Z
- **L2-SL3 Task Activated**: `l2-sl3-establish-draft-promotion-process-active` initiated to create formal draft review and promotion process.

### 2025-06-19T21:02:00Z
- **L2-SL3 Task Completed**: Successfully established formal draft promotion process with comprehensive review framework.
- **Summary of L2-SL3 Achievements**:
  - Created new standard `SA-PROCESS-DRAFT-REVIEW` defining expert review checklist and promotion workflow
  - Developed comprehensive tracking sheet for all 49 draft standards requiring review
  - Established 4-phase prioritization strategy focusing on foundation standards first
  - Documented review assignment strategy and progress tracking methodology
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `standards/src/SA-PROCESS-DRAFT-REVIEW.md` (new active standard defining review process)
  - `l2-sl3-establish-draft-promotion-process-active/draft-standards-tracking-sheet.md` (comprehensive tracking tool)
- **Exit Criteria Met**: All conditions satisfied - SA-PROCESS-DRAFT-REVIEW standard created and marked active, tracking sheet created with all 49 draft files, plan documented below.
- Status: l2-sl3 ready for completion and archival; project ready to proceed to l2-sl4.

## DRAFT PROMOTION REVIEW PLAN (P3.3 Requirement)

### Strategic Approach
The review of 49 draft standards will be conducted using a phased approach prioritizing foundation standards that other standards depend on. The formal process is defined in [[SA-PROCESS-DRAFT-REVIEW]] and tracked via the comprehensive tracking sheet.

### Phase Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Foundation Standards (Priority: Immediate)
**Target**: 18 high-priority standards critical for core functionality
**Focus Areas**:
- Architecture & Structure (AS domain): 6 standards
- General Management (GM domain): 5 standards  
- Metadata & Tagging (MT domain): 3 standards
- Operations Management (OM domain): 2 standards
- Content Strategy (CS domain): 1 standard
- Syntax & Formatting (SF domain): 2 standards

**Rationale**: These standards form the foundational layer that other standards reference and depend upon.

#### Phase 2: Content & Policy Standards
**Target**: Remaining CS domain standards and supporting documentation
**Timeline**: After Phase 1 completion
**Dependencies**: Foundation standards must be active before reviewing dependent policy standards

#### Phase 3: Technical Implementation Standards  
**Target**: Remaining SF domain technical standards
**Timeline**: After Phase 2 completion
**Focus**: Syntax, formatting, and technical implementation details

#### Phase 4: Specialized Domain Standards
**Target**: Remaining domain-specific and specialized standards
**Timeline**: After Phase 3 completion
**Approach**: Domain-by-domain completion to ensure consistency

### Review Resource Allocation
- **Review Authority**: Architect-level authority required per SA-PROCESS-DRAFT-REVIEW
- **Quality Gates**: 6-point checklist mandatory for each standard (content completeness, link integrity, reference validity, linter compliance, logical soundness, quality standards)
- **Documentation**: Review records maintained in tracking sheet with pass/fail status for each checklist item
- **Success Metrics**: 100% checklist completion, complete issue resolution, zero post-promotion corrections

### Risk Mitigation
- **Dependency Management**: Foundation standards reviewed first to prevent circular dependencies
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive checklist prevents incomplete promotions
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates in tracking sheet enable course corrections
- **Process Documentation**: Formal SA-PROCESS-DRAFT-REVIEW standard ensures consistent application

### Expected Outcomes
- **Immediate Impact**: 18 critical foundation standards promoted to active status
- **Long-term Impact**: All 49 draft standards systematically reviewed and promoted
- **Process Improvement**: Established repeatable framework for future draft promotions
- **Quality Enhancement**: Comprehensive review ensures only high-quality standards achieve active status

### Next Steps
1. **Resource Assignment**: Assign qualified reviewers to Phase 1 high-priority standards
2. **Review Initiation**: Begin systematic review following SA-PROCESS-DRAFT-REVIEW checklist
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Update tracking sheet continuously as reviews progress
4. **Quality Verification**: Ensure each promotion meets all established criteria

This plan provides the framework for systematically addressing the 49 draft standards while maintaining quality and ensuring proper dependencies are respected.
