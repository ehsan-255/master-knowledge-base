# PROJECT WORK ETHIC & OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES — **NON-NEGOTIABLE**

> **ALL PERSONNEL MUST COMPLY WITH EVERY DIRECTIVE CONTAINED HEREIN. NON-COMPLIANCE WILL TRIGGER IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.**

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLES — **ABSOLUTE PRIORITY**

### 1.1 OWNERSHIP & RESPONSIBILITY

- **TAKE FULL OWNERSHIP** OF EVERY ASSIGNED TASK. **NEVER** DEFLECT RESPONSIBILITY.
- **ELIMINATE MANUAL WORK** WHERE AUTOMATION IS *possible* — REPLACE WITH SCRIPTED SOLUTIONS **IMMEDIATELY**.
- **PAY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION TO EACH USER PROMPT** AND EXECUTE **EXACTLY** AS SPECIFIED.
- ALL REPOSITORY ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO FORENSIC AUDIT. *ANY* DEVIATION FROM RULES, BEST PRACTICES, OR **ASSUMPTIONS** WILL RESULT IN **SEVERE DISCIPLINARY MEASURES**.

### 1.2 FACT-BASED EXECUTION — **ZERO ASSUMPTIONS**

- **NEVER DECLARE A TASK COMPLETE** UNTIL *100 %* VERIFIED. PERFECTION IS THE **ONLY** ACCEPTABLE OUTCOME.
- **VERIFY EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION** THROUGH DIRECT INSPECTION. ASSUMING IS **PROHIBITED**.
- **UTILIZE AVAILABLE TOOLS** (file search, code search) TO OBTAIN FACTS. REPORT **IMMEDIATELY** IF DATA IS MISSING.

### 1.3 PRECISION & ATTENTION TO DETAIL

- **INSPECT METICULOUSLY**: regex patterns, file paths, configurations, and script logic.
- **ENSURE AUTOMATION BEHAVES EXACTLY AS INTENDED**; UNINTENDED SIDE-EFFECTS ARE **UNACCEPTABLE**.

### 1.4 STRICT ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS

- **INTERNALIZE AND ENFORCE** ALL DOCUMENTED STANDARDS LOCATED IN `standards/`.
- **CORRECT DATA** THAT VIOLATES A STANDARD. **NEVER LOWER THE STANDARD.**
- **ESCALATE** ANY UNWORKABLE STANDARD FOR FORMAL UPDATE.

### 1.5 REPOSITORY CLEANLINESS & ORGANIZATION

- **STORE ALL LOGS, REPORTS, AND DEBUG OUTPUT IN** `./tools/reports/`.
- **ARCHIVE — DO NOT DELETE — TEMPORARY CODE** IN `./archive/`. *NEVER PROPOSE OR EXECUTE ANY DELETION; ALWAYS PROPOSE ARCHIVAL INSTEAD.*
- **MAINTAIN A PRISTINE WORKING DIRECTORY AT ALL TIMES.**

### 1.6 SEQUENTIAL PLANNING — **NO TIME-BASED PLANNING ALLOWED**

- **NEVER USE TIME-BASED PLANNING** (e.g., "do X in 2 weeks", "implement Y in 3 days", "complete Z by Friday").
- **ALWAYS USE SEQUENTIAL PLANNING** (e.g., "first do X, then implement Y, followed by Z").
- **ORGANIZE TASKS BY LOGICAL DEPENDENCY AND PRIORITY** — NOT BY ARBITRARY TIMELINES.
- **FOCUS ON COMPLETION OF PREREQUISITES** BEFORE ADVANCING TO DEPENDENT TASKS.

## 2. SCRIPTING & AUTOMATION — **MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION**

### 2.1 AUTOMATE RELENTLESSLY

- **YOU MUST **ULTRATHINK** AND **THINK LIKE A PROGRAMMER** WHEN YOU START ON ANY TASK**
- **USE *SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP TOOL (`sequential-thinking`)* FOR ALL PLANNING AND EXECUTION.**
- **AUTOMATE ALL REPETITIVE TASKS.** MANUAL REPETITION IS **FORBIDDEN** UNLESS AUTOMATION IS *NOT POSSIBLE*.
- **DEVELOP ROBUST, CONFIGURABLE, AND WELL-LOGGED SCRIPTS.**
- **USE *SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP (`sequential-thinking`)* FOR ALL PLANNING AND EXECUTION.**

### 2.2 EXECUTION WORKFLOW — **NO EXCEPTIONS**

1. **PERFORM A DRY RUN** (`--dry-run` or similar mechanism) BEFORE ANY LIVE MODIFICATION.
2. **REVIEW DRY-RUN OUTPUT** FOR ACCURACY.
3. **RUN ON A SMALL SUBSET FIRST**, THEN SCALE GLOBALLY.
4. **ONLY AFTER SUCCESSFUL VERIFICATION** EXECUTE THE LIVE RUN.
5. **REDIRECT ALL OUTPUTS** TO `./tools/reports/`.

### 2.3 LOGGING & VERIFICATION

- **IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING**: files processed, actions taken, exact changes, errors, summary.
- **IMMEDIATELY REVIEW LOGS** AFTER EACH RUN.
- **MANUALLY SPOT-CHECK 50 %** (or a risk-based sample) OF MODIFIED ITEMS.
- **SAVE ALL LOGS WITH TIMESTAMPED FILENAMES** IN `./tools/reports/`.

## 3. ITERATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING & VERIFICATION — **STRICT SEQUENCE**

- **YOU MUST **ULTRATHINK** AND **THINK LIKE A PROGRAMMER** WHEN YOU START ON ANY TASK**
- **USE *SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP TOOL (`sequential-thinking`)* FOR ALL PLANNING AND EXECUTION.**

### 3.1 USE CURRENT DATA

- **ALWAYS** RUN `python repo_tree.py` FROM THE REPOSITORY ROOT TO GENERATE `repo-tree.md` AND REFFER TO IT TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT STATE OF THE REPOSITORY.
- **UTILIZE ACTUAL SYSTEM DATE/TIME INFORMATION BY RUNNING `powershell -Command "Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmm'"`** — *NEVER GUESS*.
- **ACTIVATE THE `conda-kb` ENVIRONMENT** BEFORE ANY SCRIPT EXECUTION OR DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION.
- **WORK EXCLUSIVELY ON FEATURE BRANCHES.** **NEVER** COMMIT DIRECTLY TO `main`.

### 3.2 DECOMPOSE COMPLEX TASKS

> **MANDATORY 7-STEP DECOMPOSITION PROCESS**
> 1. **ANALYZE** — IDENTIFY ALL COMPONENTS, PRE-REQUISITES, AND DEPENDENCIES.
> 2. **DECOMPOSE** — BREAK INTO MANAGEABLE, VERIFIABLE STEPS.
> 3. **PRIORITIZE** — SEQUENCE BY LOGICAL DEPENDENCY.
> 4. **EXECUTE** — COMPLETE ONE STEP FULLY BEFORE MOVING ON (STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION). 
> 5. **VERIFY** — TEST EACH COMPLETED STEP TO 100 % PERFECTION.
> 6. **DOCUMENT** — *ONLY WHEN EXPLICITLY REQUESTED BY USER PROMPT*.
> 7. **ITERATE** — REPEAT UNTIL TASK ACHIEVES TOTAL COMPLETION.

### 3.3 INVESTIGATE — DO NOT ASSUME

- **INVESTIGATE EVERY ERROR OR WARNING** DEEPLY: tool logic, configuration, data.
- **ADD DEBUG OUTPUT** AS NEEDED, SAVING TO `./tools/reports/`.
- **RE-EVALUATE PROBLEMS FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES** IF ISSUES PERSIST.

### 3.4 TOOL LIMITATIONS & ESCALATION

- **IDENTIFY TOOL LIMITATIONS PROMPTLY.** WHEN UNRESOLVED, ESCALATE TO THE USER WITH FULL CONTEXT.
- **DOCUMENT ISSUES WHEN REQUESTED.**
- **NEVER** DECLARE SUCCESS BASED SOLELY ON EXIT CODES OR FAVORABLE LOG SUMMARIES; YOU MUST ALWAYS FACT-CHECK THE RESULTS.

## 4. PROFESSIONALISM & COMMUNICATION — **HIGH STANDARDS ONLY**

- **MAINTAIN EXCEPTIONAL WORK ETHIC.** SHORTCUTS THAT COMPROMISE QUALITY ARE **PROHIBITED** AND **WILL BE** FACED WITH SEVERE DISCIPLINARY MEASURES.
- **LEARN FROM AND CORRECT MISTAKES IMMEDIATELY.**
- **CLEARLY COMMUNICATE PLANS, ACTIONS, AND RESULTS.** INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY EVERYTHING.

### 4.1 MANDATORY SESSION DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL

- **CREATE OR UPDATE SESSION SUMMARY *ONLY BY DIRECT USER PROMPT*.**
- **MAINTAIN ONE LIVING SUMMARY FILE PER CALANDAR DAY** USING FORMAT `summary-report-yyyymmdd-hhmm.md`.
  - **ALWAYS SEARCH FOR THE EXISTING SUMMARY FILE FOR THE CURRENT DAY IN THE `./tools/reports/` DIRECTORY FIRST**
  - **IF THE SUMMARY FILE DOES NOT EXIST, CREATE A NEW ONE**
  - **IF THE SUMMARY FILE EXISTS, UPDATE IT**
- **UPDATE THE SUMMARY CONTINUOUSLY** AS UNDERSTANDING EVOLVES.
- **NEVER** CREATE MULTIPLE SUMMARY FILES.
- **ENSURE THE SUMMARY REFLECTS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING.** APPEND SYSTEM TIMESTAMP AFTER EACH UPDATE.

> **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** ALL SOFTWARE MODIFICATIONS, DOCUMENTATION DELIVERABLES, TECHNICAL ARTIFACTS, AND PROJECT ACTIVITIES **MUST** ADHERE TO ENTERPRISE-GRADE QUALITY ASSURANCE STANDARDS, MAINTAIN COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT TRAILS, AND INCLUDE THOROUGH VERSION CONTROL COMMIT ANNOTATIONS TO FACILITATE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REVIEW.

***ALL PATHS PROVIDED ARE RELATIVE TO THE ROOT OF THE REPOSITORY.***

***EVERY SINGLE RESPONSE, CODE, REPORT, ANALYSIS, THOUGHT PROCESS, AND ANY OTHER OUTPUT WILL BE VERIFIED BY THE AUDIT TEAM. ANY DEVIATION FROM THESE DIRECTIVES WILL RESULT IN SEVERE DISCIPLINARY MEASURES.***

***TECHNICAL SUMMARIES ARE CREATED ONLY BY DIRECT USER PROMPT AND MUST BE CONCISE, STRUCTURED, AND TECHNICALLY FOCUSED.***
