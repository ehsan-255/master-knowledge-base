# MASTER ANALYSIS REPORT CREATION GUIDE

>**THIS GUIDE PROVIDES **MANDATORY** METHODOLOGY FOR CREATING COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL ANALYSIS REPORTS THAT SERVE AS ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINTS AND SYSTEM DESIGN FRAMEWORKS**

---

## **OVERVIEW — CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**

**THE MASTER ANALYSIS REPORT IS THE PRIMARY TECHNICAL BLUEPRINT FOR COMPLEX SYSTEMS, PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS THAT INCLUDES DESIGN PRINCIPIPLES, TECHNICAL FRAMEWORKS, IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES, AND CONSOLIDATED INSIGHTS FROM MULTIPLE DESIGN DOCUMENTS. IT IS NOT A SUMMARY OF OTHER DOCUMENTS; IT IS THE UNIFIED, AUTHORITATIVE FRAMEWORK BUILT FROM THEM.**

### **FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS**
- **PROVIDES** a high-level architectural view with sufficient technical detail to enable implementation without ambiguity
- **SERVES** as the foundational technical document from which all implementation tasks and sub-components derive
- **INTEGRATES** multiple design documents, technical analyses, and architectural decisions into a single, unified, and self-contained framework
- **DEFINES** core principles, technical architecture, and implementation roadmap for complex systems

---

## **MANDATORY STRUCTURE — STRICT COMPLIANCE**

### **0. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- **SUMMARY OVERVIEW**: Concise 3–8 sentence description of purpose, scope, and key outcomes

### **1. VISION & GUIDING PRINCIPIPLES**
- **CORE VISION**: Fundamental concept and purpose of the system/framework
- **GUIDING PRINCIPLES**: Essential principles that drive all design decisions
- **DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**: Overarching approach to solving the technical challenge
- **SUCCESS DEFINITION**: Technical success criteria and architectural goals

### **2. CONSOLIDATED ARCHITECTURE FRAMEWORK**
- **SOURCE DOCUMENTS**: List of design documents integrated into this report
- **INTEGRATED ANALYSIS**: The core content from source documents, refactored and organized into a cohesive structure. For each major component or source document, the following sections should be present:
    - **COMPONENT OVERVIEW**: Introduction to the specific architectural component.
    - **CORE PRINCIPLES**: Guiding principles for this specific component.
    - **ARCHITECTURE DEFINITION**: Detailed breakdown of the component's architecture.
- **UNIFIED FRAMEWORK**: How the separate components combine into a coherent architecture

### **3. CORE ARCHITECTURE DEFINITION**
- **ARCHITECTURAL LAYERS**: Primary structural components and their relationships
- **SYSTEM COMPONENTS**: Core technical components and their interactions
- **DATA FLOW**: How information moves through the system
- **INTEGRATION POINTS**: Key interfaces and connection mechanisms
- **KEY CHARACTERISTICS & BENEFITS**: The primary advantages and features of the proposed architecture
- **ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAMS**: Provide at least one diagram (ASCII, Mermaid, or image) illustrating component interactions

### **4. TECHNICAL FRAMEWORK SPECIFICATION**
- **FOUNDATIONAL SCHEMAS**: Core data structures, configurations, and formats
- **TECHNICAL STANDARDS**: Coding standards, conventions, and requirements
- **INTERFACE CONTRACTS**: APIs, plugin systems, and extension mechanisms
- **VALIDATION CRITERIA**: Technical validation and quality assurance requirements

### **5. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS**
- **TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS**: Specific technology choices and rationale
- **ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS**: Design patterns and architectural approaches used
- **SCALABILITY FACTORS**: Considerations for growth and performance
- **SECURITY & RELIABILITY**: Safety, security, and resilience requirements
- **KEY PILLARS / CRITICAL PRINCIPLES**: Summarize foundational principles (e.g., Reliability, Observability) guiding implementation decisions

### **6. DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**
- **IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**: Clear phases with specific technical deliverables. This section can either detail the phases or link to a separate, more comprehensive roadmap document (e.g., `master-roadmap.md`).
- **MILESTONE DEFINITIONS**: Technical milestones and completion criteria
- **DEPENDENCY MAPPING**: Technical dependencies between components/phases
- **RISK MITIGATION**: Technical risks and mitigation strategies

### **7. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**
- **CONFIGURATION SCHEMAS**: Detailed configuration formats and examples
- **CODE EXAMPLES**: Representative implementation examples
- **INTEGRATION SPECIFICATIONS**: Detailed integration requirements
- **PERFORMANCE CRITERIA**: Technical performance requirements and metrics

---

## Compliance & Validation  
The following rules are enforced automatically by CI/CD validation:
1. Every report **must** include all top-level sections listed under **Mandatory Structure**.  
2. The **Core Architecture Definition** section must contain at least one diagram (ASCII, Mermaid, or image).  
3. Submissions that fail automated checks are blocked until issues are resolved.
