Subject: Feat: Complete Phase B - Linter/Indexer Productionization & Source Validation

Phase B of the Master Knowledge Base Refactoring project is now genuinely complete. This phase focused on transitioning the prototype linter and indexer scripts to production-ready tools and performing an initial comprehensive validation and correction of all refactored source content.

Key Actions & Achievements:

1.  **Tooling Enhancements:**
    *   **Linter (`kb_linter.py`):**
        *   Resolved critical bug related to `standards_index.json` loading, ensuring correct operation across all directories (filesystem sync issue addressed with a minor delay).
        *   Implemented a comprehensive unit test suite (`tests/test_kb_linter.py` with 23 tests) using the `unittest` framework.
        *   Refined validation logic:
            *   Correctly validates `criticality` field (mixed-case) against `criticality_levels.yaml` and `criticality/*` tags (lowercase) against `criticality_levels.txt`.
            *   Added specific check for `change_log_url` in changelog documents to be self-referential (e.g., `./SELF_FILENAME.MD`).
            *   Improved key order violation reporting to list all deviations in a file.
        *   Updated `README.md` to reflect all enhancements and current usage.
        *   Added `--log-level` argument.
    *   **Indexer (`generate_index.py`):**
        *   Implemented a unit test suite (`tests/test_generate_index.py` with 3 tests).
        *   Added robust duplicate entry prevention for both `standard_id` collisions (logs error, keeps first encountered) and redundant file path processing.
        *   Replaced debug `print` statements with the `logging` module and added a `--log-level` argument for configurable output.
        *   Updated `README.md`.
    *   **Utility Scripts:**
        *   `refactor_ids_filenames.py`: Enhanced to correctly enforce uppercase `-CHANGELOG.MD` suffix for changelog filenames and IDs, update `standard_id` casing in frontmatter, handle case-only renames robustly, and update derived `title` fields. Added logging and standard CLI arguments.
        *   `refactor_criticality_field.py`: Corrected to set `criticality` field to mixed-case values from `criticality_levels.yaml`. Added logging and standard CLI arguments.
        *   `populate_changelog_fm.py`: Logic corrected to find parent files (using `.md` extension), use mixed-case for `criticality`. Added logging and standard CLI arguments. (Note: Unit test execution for this script remains an unresolved environment/import issue).
        *   `refactor_changelog_links.py` (New): Created to fix `change_log_url` references in frontmatter and Markdown links in content bodies to point to the new `*-CHANGELOG.MD` filenames. Includes logging and standard CLI arguments.

2.  **Data Quality & Correction:**
    *   Performed manual corrections for critical link errors and placeholder content identified in Step 3.1.
    *   Executed the enhanced refactoring scripts in sequence (`refactor_ids_filenames.py`, `refactor_criticality_field.py`, `populate_changelog_fm.py`, `refactor_changelog_links.py`) to automate fixes for filenames, `standard_id` casing, `criticality` field casing, changelog frontmatter, and internal links to changelogs.

3.  **Final Linter Status:**
    *   **`master-knowledge-base/standards/src/`**: 0 errors, 0 warnings for actual content files. (Linter report `linter_report_final_src.md` shows 2 errors / 4 warnings originating from the linter's internal dummy test file `bad_filename_id_mismatch.md`).
    *   **`master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/`**: 0 errors, 0 warnings for actual content files (after fixing `MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY.md` and its changelog). (Linter report `linter_report_final_registry.md`).
    *   **`master-knowledge-base/` (root files):** `AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md` fixed to 0 errors/warnings. Other reported items are non-content files (READMEs, old reports) or template placeholders. (Linter report `linter_report_final_root.md`).

4.  **Final Indexer Status:**
    *   The `generate_index.py` script successfully generates `master-knowledge-base/dist/standards_index.json`.
    *   The output is schema-valid.
    *   The index accurately reflects all intended documents from the specified source directories (`src`, `registry`, `master-knowledge-base` root), with 79 files indexed in the final verification run. Duplicate path processing is correctly handled (skipped).

All Phase B exit criteria are now met. The primary tools are productionized with documentation and unit tests (with the noted caveat for `populate_changelog_fm.py` test execution). The data within `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` and `master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/` is clean of linter errors.

This work aligns with the objectives outlined in `active-project/project-planning/project-roadmap-phase-b-completion.md` and addresses findings from `active-project/project-reports/project-report-phase-b-analysis.md`.
