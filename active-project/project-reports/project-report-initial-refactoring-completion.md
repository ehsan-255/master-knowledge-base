### Overall Progress Summary

The project has successfully transitioned from monolithic collections to an atomic structure for standards. Phase 0 (Foundations & Definitions) is largely complete, with core conventions and registries established. The structural decomposition of old standards (Phases 1 & 2) is well advanced, with most legacy concepts mapped to new atomic files. Key automation tools (linter, indexer, collection builder) have been implemented with core logic and are beyond mere skeletons, though full productionizing (CI integration, comprehensive error handling) remains.

The most critical remaining task is the **systematic enrichment of YAML frontmatter** for all newly created or refactored *active* atomic standard documents in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` to fully comply with the new `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md` schema. A thorough audit and update of `status: deprecated` for all superseded legacy files is also required.

Detailed progress, including specific file refactoring logs, can be found in `master-knowledge-base/note.md` (e.g., entries for 2025-05-29).

### Phase-by-Phase Progress Report

*   **Phase 0: Foundations, Definitions & Initial Tooling**
    *   **Status:** Substantially Complete.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   **Naming Conventions & Identifiers (Step 0.1):** Atomic file naming convention defined. The `PRIMARY_TOPIC_KEYWORD` component of `standard_id`s has been algorithmically derived using `derive_primary_keyword.py`, with results in `drafts/primary-keyword-mapping.csv` showing zero raw collisions; this component is now locked in. The `standard_id` regex and filename/`standard_id` equivalence rule are documented in `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md`.
        *   **Controlled Vocabularies & Registries (Step 0.2):** Core registry files (e.g., `domain_codes.yaml`, `subdomain_registry.yaml`, `info_types.txt`, `criticality_levels.yaml`, `lifecycle_gatekeepers.yaml`, `tag_categories.txt`) are established in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/registry/`. `tag-glossary-definition.md` has been updated and moved to this registry.
        *   **Metadata Schema & Core Docs (Step 0.3):** `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md` defines the new comprehensive frontmatter schema. `tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` (in `/standards/templates/`) is updated. `SF-LINKS-INTERNAL-SYNTAX.md` defines the `[[STANDARD_ID]]` link style with a transitional policy for path-based links (Phase 0: warning).
        *   **Directory Structure (Step 0.4):** The `/standards/src/`, `/standards/registry/`, and `/standards/templates/` structure is defined and populated.
        *   **Initial Automation Development (Step 0.5):**
            *   `kb_linter.py`: Implemented with core logic for many checks (frontmatter, file hygiene, key validation, link styles, vocab loading from registries). Supports severity levels.
            *   `generate_index.py`: Implemented with core logic for metadata extraction and `standards_index.json` generation (including `schemaVersion`).
            *   `standards_index.schema.json`: Schema for the index is defined.
            *   `validate_registry.py`: Implemented for validating registry files.
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 0:**
        *   Full testing and refinement of linter and indexer scripts to ensure robustness.
        *   (Optional) CI workflow specification/implementation.

*   **Phase 1: Atomic Decomposition, Splitting & Metadata Enrichment**
    *   **Status:** Structural decomposition largely complete. Metadata enrichment for *active* files and comprehensive deprecation marking for *legacy* files are the major outstanding parts.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   **Processing Collection Files (Steps 1.1-1.6):** All old `COL-*.md` files reviewed. Their concepts mapped to atomic standards in `/standards/src/`. Collection files marked as deprecated.
        *   **Specific Merging/Refactoring (Step 1.7):** Key conceptual merges (linking, ToC, callouts, tagging, etc.) addressed by creating/verifying generalized atomic standards.
        *   **Refactor Guide Documents (Step 1.8):** `GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.md` and `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.md` created in `/standards/src/` and refactored.
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 1:**
        *   **Systematic Metadata Enrichment:** All *active* atomic files in `/standards/src/` require their frontmatter to be updated to the full new schema in `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md`. (Note: Deprecated legacy files in their original locations will intentionally remain on the old frontmatter schema, only updated with `status: deprecated` and a deprecation notice).
        *   **Audit & Update Legacy File Statuses:** Systematically ensure every superseded `COL-*.md`, `U-*.md`, and `M-*.md` file in the old `standards/` directory has `status: deprecated` in its frontmatter and an explicit link to its replacement(s) in `/standards/src/`.
        *   Linter to transition from `warning` to `error` for path-based links upon Phase 1 exit.

*   **Phase 2: Governance Review & Standalone/Utility Document Refactoring**
    *   **Status:** Structural refactoring largely complete. Metadata enrichment for active files and full Standard/Policy review outstanding.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   **Refactor Existing Standalone Standard Files (Step 2.2):** Many old `U-*.md`, `M-*.md` standards processed, either superseded or refactored into new atomic files in `/standards/src/`.
        *   **Refactor Glossary & Definition Files (Step 2.3):** Key files like `GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS.md`, `MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY.md`, `UA-KEYDEFS-GLOBAL.md`, and `AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB.md` created/updated.
        *   **Refactor Root & Navigational Files (Step 2.4):** `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` and `AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md` created.
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 2:**
        *   **Systematic Metadata Enrichment:** As with Phase 1, all *active* files created/refactored in this phase need full frontmatter updates.
        *   **Systematic Governance Review (Step 2.1):** Full review of all Standard Definition vs. Policy Document pairs for correct content allocation.
        *   Populate ToCs in `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` and `AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md`.
        *   Resolve unmapped placeholders (from `note.md`).

*   **Phase 3: Template Finalization & Link Style Enforcement**
    *   **Status:** Partially Started.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   **Template Files (Step 3.1):** `tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` is updated and located in `/standards/templates/`. `/standards/templates/README.md` created. (Note: Older templates in the root `/templates/` directory are pending cleanup/removal).
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 3:**
        *   Create `tpl-standard-definition.md` and `tpl-policy-document.md` in `/standards/templates/`.
        *   Systematic enforcement of `[[STANDARD_ID]]` link style across all documents.

*   **Phase 4: Design & Implementation of Derived Views & Production Automation**
    *   **Status:** Core logic implemented for key tools.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   **Derived "Collection" View Generation (Step 4.1):** `generate_collections.py` implemented with core logic for filtering, content aggregation, ToC generation, and advanced link resolution. `collection_definitions.yaml` example exists.
        *   **Indexer (Step 4.2):** `generate_index.py` implemented with core functionality.
        *   **Linter (Step 4.3):** `kb_linter.py` implemented with core functionality and extended checks.
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 4:**
        *   Full productionizing (robust error handling, comprehensive testing) of `generate_collections.py`, `generate_index.py`, and `kb_linter.py`.
        *   CI/CD integration.

*   **Phase 5: Final Validation, Review & Documentation**
    *   **Status:** Planning Complete.
    *   **Key Achievements:**
        *   Detailed plans for "Full System Validation" and "Final Peer Review & System Documentation" drafted (in `note.md`).
    *   **Remaining Tasks for Phase 5:**
        *   Execution of all validation, review, and documentation tasks post-tool productionizing and content enrichment.

### Quality Assessment

*   **Standards Refactoring (Content & Structure):**
    *   **Positive:** Excellent progress in atomic structuring, `standard_id` system, naming conventions, deprecation of collections, Standard/Policy conceptual split, and registry establishment. The `derive_primary_keyword.py` script has successfully confirmed the `PRIMARY_TOPIC_KEYWORD` strategy, which is a key component of `standard_id`s.
    *   **Area for Improvement:**
        1.  **Metadata Enrichment:** The highest priority is the systematic update of YAML frontmatter for all *active* atomic files in `/standards/src/` to the new schema. (Deprecated legacy files will retain old frontmatter).
        2.  **Standard/Policy Review:** A systematic review of all Standard Definition vs. Policy Document pairs is needed.
        3.  **Clarify `PRIMARY_TOPIC_KEYWORD` vs. `primary-topic` Field:** The `derive_primary_keyword.py` script produces the keyword component for `standard_id` (e.g., `KB-ROOT`). The frontmatter field `primary-topic:` remains a distinct, human-authored descriptive phrase (e.g., "Knowledge Base Root Structure"). This distinction should be clear in relevant documentation.

*   **Templates:**
    *   **Positive:** `tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` is updated and correctly located in `/standards/templates/`. README created.
    *   **Area for Improvement:** Creation of `tpl-standard-definition.md` and `tpl-policy-document.md`. Cleanup of legacy templates from the root `/templates/` directory.

*   **Tools and Scripts:**
    *   **Positive:** The Python scripts (`derive_primary_keyword.py`, `kb_linter.py`, `generate_index.py`, `generate_collections.py`, `validate_registry.py`) are implemented with significant core logic, well beyond initial skeletons.
    *   **Area for Improvement:** These tools require final productionizing: comprehensive error handling, full implementation of all specified features (e.g., dynamic loading of *all* vocabularies from registry files for the linter), and thorough testing.

### Key Remaining Tasks & Recommendations

1.  **Systematic Frontmatter Enrichment:** Update YAML frontmatter for ALL *active* atomic files in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` per `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md`.
2.  **Audit & Update Legacy File Statuses:** Ensure every superseded `COL-*.md`, `U-*.md`, and `M-*.md` file has `status: deprecated` and a link to its replacement.
3.  **Full Standard/Policy Content Review:** Systematically review all atomic standards for correct HOW/WHERE vs. WHAT/WHEN/WHY content allocation.
4.  **Registry Completeness & Linter Vocabulary Alignment:** Validate and finalize all registry files in `/standards/registry/`. Ensure the linter loads and uses these for comprehensive vocabulary checks.
5.  **Tool Productionizing & Linter Findings Resolution:** Fully implement, test, and make robust the linter, indexer, and collection builder. Address critical warnings/errors reported by the current linter.
6.  **Template Creation:** Develop `tpl-standard-definition.md` and `tpl-policy-document.md` in `/standards/templates/`.
7.  **Link Style Enforcement:** Systematically update all internal links to `[[STANDARD_ID]]` style.
8.  **Resolve Unmapped Placeholders:** Investigate and fix placeholder links.
9.  **Populate Navigational Files:** Fully populate ToCs in `AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md` and `AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md`.
10. **CI/CD Integration:** Implement CI/CD workflows.
11. **Final System Validation & Documentation:** Execute Phase 5 tasks.

### Conclusion

The refactoring project is well-positioned. The foundational architecture is solid, and key tooling has seen significant development. Addressing the metadata enrichment for active files and systematically auditing legacy file statuses are the most pressing next steps. Completing the productionizing of tools and acting on their findings will then pave the way for final validation and the realization of a robust, maintainable standards ecosystem. The detailed logs in `master-knowledge-base/note.md` provide excellent traceability for the work completed.
