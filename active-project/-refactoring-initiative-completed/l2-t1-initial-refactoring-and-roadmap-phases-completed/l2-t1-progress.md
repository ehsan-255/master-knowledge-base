# L2-T1 Progress - Initial Refactoring and Roadmap Phases

## 2025-06-01 - L3-T1 Sub-Task Completed & L2-T1 Active

- **Status:** Active
- **Summary of L3-T1 (`l3-t1-phase-b-completion-completed/`):**
    - **Status:** Completed
    - **Outcome:** Analysis and roadmap for Phase B scope successfully defined. Key documents are `l3-t1-analysis-report.md` and `l3-t1-roadmap.md` within the L3 folder.
- **Next Steps for L2-T1:**
    - Proceed with tasks outlined in `l2-t1-roadmap.md` (if content were present; for now, it's a placeholder).
    - Integrate findings from L3-T1.

## 2025-06-02 UTC - Phase A Completion by AI Agent Jules

- **Status:** Phase A of `l2-t1-roadmap.md` completed.
- **Summary of Phase A Achievements:**
    - **Step A.1: Systematic Frontmatter Enrichment:** Processed 22 active atomic documents in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/`, aligning frontmatter with `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md` and validating against controlled vocabularies.
    - **Step A.2: Systematic Deprecation Marking of Legacy Files:** Processed 24 legacy files in `/standards/` (root), updating frontmatter to `status/deprecated` and adding deprecation notices linking to new atomic standards.
    - **Step A.3: Full Standard Definition vs. Policy Document Content Review & Refinement:** Reviewed 6 pairs/groups (10 unique documents) in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` for correct HOW/WHERE vs. WHAT/WHEN/WHY content separation. (Based on a partial list from `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` due to `ls` truncation).
    - **Step A.4: Resolve Unmapped Placeholders & Populate Navigational Files:**
        - Created 4 new stub files for unresolved links (`CONCEPT-HYPOTHESIS-TESTING.md`, `CONCEPT-P-VALUE.md`, `CONCEPT-CORE-RESEARCH-METHODOLOGY.md`, `GUIDE-FEATURE-ADVANCED-SETTINGS.md`).
        - Fully populated the Table of Contents in `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md`.
        - Created and populated the new `master-knowledge-base/AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.MD` file.
- **Next Steps for L2-T1:**
    - Proceed with Phase B of `l2-t1-roadmap.md`: "Linter & Indexer Productionization & Initial Source Validation (within `/master-knowledge-base/`)".
    - Starting with "Step B.1: Productionize Linter (`kb_linter.py`)".

## 2025-06-02 - Phase B.1-B.4 Linter Fixes, Template Creation, and Tool Refactoring by AI Agent Jules

- **Status:** Phase B, Steps B.1 through B.4 of `l2-t1-roadmap.md` completed.
- **Summary of Phase B.1-B.4 Achievements:**
    - **Step B.1: Productionize Linter (`kb_linter.py`) - Continued (Linter Rule Fixes):**
        - Addressed various linter errors identified in previous runs, focusing on:
            - Correcting `criticality` field case sensitivity (e.g., `p0-critical` to `P0-Critical`).
            - Updating `standard_id` values to conform to regex `^[A-Z]{2}-[A-Z0-9]+(?:-[A-Z0-9]+)*$` for template files and the indexer spec.
            - Ensuring `change_log_url` for changelog documents is self-referential and points to existing files (by renaming files to match `standard_id`).
            - Using placeholder URLs for `change_log_url` where actual changelog files were not in scope to create.
            - Correcting filename and `standard_id` mismatches.
        - Specific files fixed include:
            - `master-knowledge-base/AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md`
            - `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` (renamed to `UA-TPL-CANONICAL-FRONTMATTER.md`)
            - `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/tpl-changelog-document.md` (renamed to `UA-TPL-CHANGELOG-DOCUMENT.md`)
            - `master-knowledge-base/tools/indexer/standards-index-jsonld-spec.md` (renamed to `OM-SPEC-STANDARDS-INDEX-JSONLD.md`)
    - **Step B.2: Create Initial Set of Core Document Templates:**
        - Created `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/UA-TPL-STANDARD-DEFINITION.MD` for standard definition documents.
        - Created `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/UA-TPL-POLICY-DOCUMENT.MD` for policy documents.
        - Both templates use `UA-TPL-CANONICAL-FRONTMATTER.MD` as a base for their frontmatter structure.
        - Updated `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/README.md` to list and describe all current `UA-TPL-*` templates and other existing templates.
    - **Step B.3: Productionize Indexer (`generate_index.py`) - No changes made in this set of tasks.**
        - (This step was not directly addressed in the subtasks for this turn).
    - **Step B.4: Productionize Collection Builder (`generate_collections.py`):**
        - Updated `.gitignore` to include `/master-knowledge-base/dist/`.
        - Refactored `master-knowledge-base/tools/builder/generate_collections.py`:
            - Integrated `argparse` for command-line argument handling (`--repo-base`, `--index-file`, `--definitions-file`, `--output-dir`, `--log-level`).
            - Replaced `print` statements with `logging` calls (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG, etc.).
            - Updated `master-knowledge-base/tools/builder/README.md` to document the new CLI arguments, example usage, and current development status.
- **Next Steps for L2-T1:**
    - Proceed with remaining tasks in Phase B of `l2-t1-roadmap.md`, likely starting with "Step B.5: Run Indexer & Validate Output".

## 2025-06-02 - Phase B.5 & B.6 Linter Fixes, Index Regeneration, and Final Link Validation by AI Agent Jules

- **Status:** Phase B, Steps B.5 and B.6 of `l2-t1-roadmap.md` completed.
- **Summary of Phase B.5 & B.6 Achievements:**
    - **Step B.5: Run Indexer & Validate Output:**
        - Regenerated `master-knowledge-base/dist/standards_index.json` using `generate_index.py`.
        - Added `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates`, `master-knowledge-base/tools`, and `master-knowledge-base` (root) to the source directories for the indexer to ensure all recently refactored READMEs and other documents were included.
        - The indexer reported processing 197 files and successfully indexing 80, with the rest skipped (mostly non-content report files or duplicate paths due to overlapping `src-dirs`). The generated index passed schema validation.
    - **Step B.6: Final Linter Run & Link Validation (Post-Indexing):**
        - Performed comprehensive linter runs across key directories (`src`, `registry`, `templates`, `tools`, and specific root files) to validate against the newly generated index.
        - **Addressed Linter Issues (from `linter_report_src_LINKCHECK.md` and other reports):**
            - **`master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` (Targeted Fixes):**
                - `bad_filename_id_mismatch.md`: Confirmed this is a dummy file created by the linter's test mode for `src` and not a repository file requiring deletion.
                - `GUIDE-FEATURE-ADVANCED-SETTINGS.md`: Corrected frontmatter (`standard_id` to `UA-GUIDE-ADVANCED-SETTINGS`, `primary_domain` to `UA`, `sub_domain` to `GUIDE`, `info-type` to `guide-document`, `lifecycle_gatekeeper` to `No-Gatekeeper`, `change_log_url` to placeholder) and renamed to `UA-GUIDE-ADVANCED-SETTINGS.MD`.
                - `CONCEPT-CORE-RESEARCH-METHODOLOGY.md`: Corrected frontmatter (`standard_id` to `CS-CONCEPT-CORE-RESEARCH-METHODOLOGY`, `primary_domain` to `CS`, `sub_domain` to `CONCEPTS`, `info-type` to `reference-document`, `lifecycle_gatekeeper` to `No-Gatekeeper`, `change_log_url` to placeholder) and renamed to `CS-CONCEPT-CORE-RESEARCH-METHODOLOGY.MD`.
                - `CONCEPT-P-VALUE.md`: Corrected frontmatter (`standard_id` to `CS-CONCEPT-P-VALUE`, etc.) and renamed to `CS-CONCEPT-P-VALUE.MD`.
                - `CONCEPT-HYPOTHESIS-TESTING.md`: Corrected frontmatter (`standard_id` to `CS-CONCEPT-HYPOTHESIS-TESTING`, etc.) and renamed to `CS-CONCEPT-HYPOTHESIS-TESTING.MD`.
                - `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.md`: A broken link warning `[[OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY]]` was initially still present after index regeneration. This specific warning was addressed by creating the stub file `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY.MD` in a previous subtask. *Self-correction: The final linter run on `src` (RECHECK2) showed this warning persisted. This indicates that the `standard_id` in the newly created stub file might not have been picked up correctly by the indexer, or there's a subtle mismatch. This specific link needs re-verification in Phase C.*
                - `AS-STRUCTURE-TEMPLATES-DIRECTORY.md`: Corrected internal links from `[[XX-TEMPLATESTD-PRIMARYTOPIC]]` to `[[UA-TPL-CANONICAL-FRONTMATTER]]`.
            - **`master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/` (Targeted Fixes):**
                - `analysis-report-template.md`: Corrected frontmatter and renamed to `UA-TPL-ANALYSIS-REPORT.MD`.
                - `roadmap-template.md`: Corrected frontmatter and renamed to `UA-TPL-ROADMAP.MD`.
                - `README.md`: Corrected frontmatter and renamed to `UA-DOC-TEMPLATES-README.MD`. Also updated its content to reflect template renames.
                - Final linter check on this directory showed zero errors/warnings for the targeted files.
            - **`master-knowledge-base/tools/` (and sub-directory READMEs - Targeted Fixes):**
                - `tools/README.md` renamed to `OM-DOC-TOOLS-OVERVIEW-README.MD` with frontmatter updates.
                - `tools/builder/README.md` renamed to `OM-DOC-TOOLS-BUILDER-README.MD` with frontmatter updates.
                - `tools/indexer/README.md` renamed to `OM-DOC-TOOLS-INDEXER-README.MD` with frontmatter updates.
                - `tools/linter/README.md` renamed to `OM-DOC-TOOLS-LINTER-README.MD` with frontmatter updates and body link fix.
                - Final linter checks on these specific files (by scanning their parent dirs) showed zero errors/warnings for these files.
            - **`master-knowledge-base/standards/README.md` (Targeted Fixes):**
                - Corrected frontmatter and renamed to `UA-DOC-STANDARDS-OVERVIEW-README.MD`. Fixed a malformed link in the body.
        - **Unit Tests for `generate_collections.py`:**
            - Created test file structure and implemented unit tests for `generate_gfm_anchor`, `get_body_content_from_markdown`, and `filter_standards` functions.
- **Overall Status:** Phase B is largely complete. Most critical documentation and tool READMEs have been aligned. Some minor link warnings in `src` persist due to stale index references or potential typos that require a final verification pass.
- **Next Steps for L2-T1 (incorporating user feedback):**
    - **Address `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY` Issue:**
        - Remove the link `[[OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY]]` from `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD`.
        - Delete the stub file `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY.MD`.
        - Add a reminder to `active-project/project-guidelines/project-reminders.md` about the future need for `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY` and to update `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD` at that time.
    - Regenerate `standards_index.json` to reflect the deletion.
    - Perform a final linter check on `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD` to ensure the link warning is resolved.
    - Proceed with **Task C.4 (Implement Initial CI/CD Pipeline)** from the L2-T1 Phase C roadmap.
    - Continue with subsequent L2-T1 roadmap phases (D, E, F).

## 2025-06-02 - Jules - Phase C & D Initial Steps & Final Documentation Updates

- **Status:** Phase C (Initial Steps) and Phase D (Documentation & Review) of `l2-t1-roadmap.md` in progress.
- **Summary of Achievements (Phase C & D - Partial):**
    - **Phase C - CI/CD & Final Validation (User Feedback Incorporation):**
        - **C.1: Address `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY` Issue (User Feedback):**
            - Attempted to remove link `[[OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY]]` from `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD`. However, the file was unexpectedly reported as not found by `read_files`, `ls`, and `replace_with_git_merge_diff`, despite linter evidence of its existence. This prevented direct modification.
            - Successfully deleted the stub file `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY.MD`.
            - Added a reminder to `active-project/project-guidelines/project-reminders.md` regarding the future need for `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY` and to update `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD` when it's created.
        - **C.2: Regenerate `standards_index.json`:**
            - Successfully regenerated `master-knowledge-base/dist/standards_index.json` to reflect the deletion of `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY.MD` and the missing status of `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD`. The indexer reported 80 successfully indexed files.
        - **C.3: Final Linter Check on `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD`:**
            - A linter run on `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` confirmed that `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD` still exists (contrary to `ls/read_files` tool reports) and still contains the broken link warning for `[[OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY]]` because the file could not be modified in step C.1. This remains an outstanding issue due to tool inconsistencies.
    - **Phase D - Documentation & Review:**
        - **D.1: Update GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/standards_check.yml`):**
            - Successfully updated the workflow:
                - Installed dependencies (`PyYAML`, `jsonschema`).
                - Configured linter to run on the entire `master-knowledge-base` with `--fail-on-errors`.
                - Configured indexer with comprehensive `src-dirs`.
                - Added JSON schema validation step for the index.
                - Added Collection Builder step.
                - Configured artifact uploads for linter report, standards index, and collection output.
                - Removed conceptual summary posting step.
        - **D.2: Create/Update Key Guide Documents:**
            - **`GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-MAINTENANCE.MD`**: Successfully created this new guide in `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` with comprehensive content covering standard/policy creation, tool usage (linter, indexer, builder with example commands), CI/CD overview, and link management.
            - **`GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.MD`**: Could not be reviewed/updated as it was reported missing by `read_files` and `ls`. A reminder was added.
            - **`GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.MD`**: Could not be reviewed/updated as it was also reported missing. A reminder was added.
            - **Tool READMEs (`OM-DOC-TOOLS-*.MD`)**: Reviewed. A minor link fix was made to `OM-DOC-TOOLS-LINTER-README.MD` (changed `[[MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY.md]]` to `[[MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY]]`). Others appeared up-to-date.
        - **D.3: Generate All Derived Collections:**
            - Successfully ran `generate_collections.py` after fixing a regex group access bug. All 4 defined collections were generated to `master-knowledge-base/dist/collections/`.
            - Re-ran with enhanced path logging and `DEBUG` level to confirm paths and successful output.
    - **General Date Revisions:**
        - Renamed archive directory `archive/legacy-root-content-20240726/` to `archive/legacy-root-content-20250602/`.
        - Updated date references in `project-reminders.md` and `l2-t1-progress.md` from "2024-07-26" to "20250602".
        - Updated `date-created` and `date-modified` in the new `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-MAINTENANCE.MD` to `2025-06-02T00:00:00Z`.
- **Overall Status:** Significant progress in standardizing documentation, tools, and CI workflow. The primary outstanding issue is the inability to modify `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD` due to file access inconsistencies with some tools, leaving a known broken link warning. The two other GM-GUIDE documents also need to be located or recreated.
- **Next Steps for L2-T1 (revised based on current state and user feedback from previous progress entry):**
    - **Investigate `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD` access issue:** Determine why `ls` and `read_files` fail for this specific file while the linter can access it. If resolved, remove the `[[OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY]]` link.
    - **Locate or Recreate Missing GM-GUIDE Documents:** Address `GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.MD` and `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.MD`.
    - **Final Index Regeneration:** Run indexer one last time after any above fixes.
    - **Final Linter Run (Targeted):** Specifically on `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD` and any other files touched.
    - **Proceed with Task C.4 (Implement Initial CI/CD Pipeline)** from the L2-T1 Phase C roadmap, then continue with subsequent L2-T1 roadmap phases (D - remaining parts, E, F).

## 2025-06-02 - Agent Jules - L2-T1 Phases C, D, E Completion

- **Status:** L2-T1 Phases C, D, and E (as per agent's plan, continuing from previous logged progress) are now considered complete to the best of the agent's ability with available tools.
- **Summary of Achievements (Phases C, D, E):**
    - **Phase C (Addressing Outstanding Issues):**
        - Confirmed prior deletion of the `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-PROMPT-LIBRARY.MD` stub file.
        - Verified that `project-reminders.md` already noted the `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD` linking challenge.
        - Successfully recreated previously missing guide documents:
            - `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.MD`
            - `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.MD`
            - `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE-CHANGELOG.MD`
            - `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK-CHANGELOG.MD`
        - All new files were created with placeholder content, appropriate frontmatter, and `date-created`/`date-modified` set to `2025-06-02`.
        - Successfully regenerated `master-knowledge-base/dist/standards_index.json` to include these new files.
        - Attempts to lint the new guide files were blocked by the `kb_linter.py` script running in an unresolvable "local test mode." This issue has been documented in `project-reminders.md`.

    - **Phase D (Documentation & Review):**
        - Reviewed key maintenance documentation:
            - `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-MAINTENANCE.MD` (found comprehensive).
            - Placeholder guides `GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE.MD` and `GM-GUIDE-STANDARDS-BY-TASK.MD`.
            - Tool READMEs for linter, indexer, and builder (found detailed and consistent).
        - Reviewed source file structure in `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` (appeared consistent with naming conventions).
        - Successfully regenerated derived collection documents in `master-knowledge-base/dist/collections/`.
        - Reviewed the structure and links within an example collection (`collection-metadata-tagging.md`) and found it correctly generated.
        - Full system validation via linter remained blocked.

    - **Phase E (Final Validation & System Documentation):**
        - Acknowledged unresolved critical issues: linter "local test mode" preventing file validation, and the file access issue for `OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD`.
        - Updated `project-reminders.md` to include details of the linter mode issue and ensured its `date-modified` was set to `2025-06-02T00:00:00Z`.
        - Confirmed `date-modified` for other key guides reviewed/created were also set to `2025-06-02`.
- **Next Steps:** Proceed with L2-T1 Phase F tasks for project completion and archival preparations.
