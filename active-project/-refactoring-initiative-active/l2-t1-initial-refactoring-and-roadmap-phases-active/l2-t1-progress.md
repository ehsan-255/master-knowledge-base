# L2-T1 Progress - Initial Refactoring and Roadmap Phases

## 2025-06-01 - L3-T1 Sub-Task Completed & L2-T1 Active

- **Status:** Active
- **Summary of L3-T1 (`l3-t1-phase-b-completion-completed/`):**
    - **Status:** Completed
    - **Outcome:** Analysis and roadmap for Phase B scope successfully defined. Key documents are `l3-t1-analysis-report.md` and `l3-t1-roadmap.md` within the L3 folder.
- **Next Steps for L2-T1:**
    - Proceed with tasks outlined in `l2-t1-roadmap.md` (if content were present; for now, it's a placeholder).
    - Integrate findings from L3-T1.

## 2025-06-02 UTC - Phase A Completion by AI Agent Jules

- **Status:** Phase A of `l2-t1-roadmap.md` completed.
- **Summary of Phase A Achievements:**
    - **Step A.1: Systematic Frontmatter Enrichment:** Processed 22 active atomic documents in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/`, aligning frontmatter with `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md` and validating against controlled vocabularies.
    - **Step A.2: Systematic Deprecation Marking of Legacy Files:** Processed 24 legacy files in `/standards/` (root), updating frontmatter to `status/deprecated` and adding deprecation notices linking to new atomic standards.
    - **Step A.3: Full Standard Definition vs. Policy Document Content Review & Refinement:** Reviewed 6 pairs/groups (10 unique documents) in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` for correct HOW/WHERE vs. WHAT/WHEN/WHY content separation. (Based on a partial list from `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` due to `ls` truncation).
    - **Step A.4: Resolve Unmapped Placeholders & Populate Navigational Files:**
        - Created 4 new stub files for unresolved links (`CONCEPT-HYPOTHESIS-TESTING.md`, `CONCEPT-P-VALUE.md`, `CONCEPT-CORE-RESEARCH-METHODOLOGY.md`, `GUIDE-FEATURE-ADVANCED-SETTINGS.md`).
        - Fully populated the Table of Contents in `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md`.
        - Created and populated the new `master-knowledge-base/AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.MD` file.
- **Next Steps for L2-T1:**
    - Proceed with Phase B of `l2-t1-roadmap.md`: "Linter & Indexer Productionization & Initial Source Validation (within `/master-knowledge-base/`)".
    - Starting with "Step B.1: Productionize Linter (`kb_linter.py`)".

## 2024-07-26 10:23:00 UTC - Phase B.1-B.4 Linter Fixes, Template Creation, and Tool Refactoring by AI Agent Jules

- **Status:** Phase B, Steps B.1 through B.4 of `l2-t1-roadmap.md` completed.
- **Summary of Phase B.1-B.4 Achievements:**
    - **Step B.1: Productionize Linter (`kb_linter.py`) - Continued (Linter Rule Fixes):**
        - Addressed various linter errors identified in previous runs, focusing on:
            - Correcting `criticality` field case sensitivity (e.g., `p0-critical` to `P0-Critical`).
            - Updating `standard_id` values to conform to regex `^[A-Z]{2}-[A-Z0-9]+(?:-[A-Z0-9]+)*$` for template files and the indexer spec.
            - Ensuring `change_log_url` for changelog documents is self-referential and points to existing files (by renaming files to match `standard_id`).
            - Using placeholder URLs for `change_log_url` where actual changelog files were not in scope to create.
            - Correcting filename and `standard_id` mismatches.
        - Specific files fixed include:
            - `master-knowledge-base/AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.md`
            - `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/tpl-canonical-frontmatter.md` (renamed to `UA-TPL-CANONICAL-FRONTMATTER.md`)
            - `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/tpl-changelog-document.md` (renamed to `UA-TPL-CHANGELOG-DOCUMENT.md`)
            - `master-knowledge-base/tools/indexer/standards-index-jsonld-spec.md` (renamed to `OM-SPEC-STANDARDS-INDEX-JSONLD.md`)
    - **Step B.2: Create Initial Set of Core Document Templates:**
        - Created `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/UA-TPL-STANDARD-DEFINITION.MD` for standard definition documents.
        - Created `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/UA-TPL-POLICY-DOCUMENT.MD` for policy documents.
        - Both templates use `UA-TPL-CANONICAL-FRONTMATTER.MD` as a base for their frontmatter structure.
        - Updated `master-knowledge-base/standards/templates/README.md` to list and describe all current `UA-TPL-*` templates and other existing templates.
    - **Step B.3: Productionize Indexer (`generate_index.py`) - No changes made in this set of tasks.**
        - (This step was not directly addressed in the subtasks for this turn).
    - **Step B.4: Productionize Collection Builder (`generate_collections.py`):**
        - Updated `.gitignore` to include `/master-knowledge-base/dist/`.
        - Refactored `master-knowledge-base/tools/builder/generate_collections.py`:
            - Integrated `argparse` for command-line argument handling (`--repo-base`, `--index-file`, `--definitions-file`, `--output-dir`, `--log-level`).
            - Replaced `print` statements with `logging` calls (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG, etc.).
            - Updated `master-knowledge-base/tools/builder/README.md` to document the new CLI arguments, example usage, and current development status.
- **Next Steps for L2-T1:**
    - Proceed with remaining tasks in Phase B of `l2-t1-roadmap.md`, likely starting with "Step B.5: Run Indexer & Validate Output".
