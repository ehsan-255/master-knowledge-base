# L2-T1 Progress - Initial Refactoring and Roadmap Phases

## 2025-06-01 - L3-T1 Sub-Task Completed & L2-T1 Active

- **Status:** Active
- **Summary of L3-T1 (`l3-t1-phase-b-completion-completed/`):**
    - **Status:** Completed
    - **Outcome:** Analysis and roadmap for Phase B scope successfully defined. Key documents are `l3-t1-analysis-report.md` and `l3-t1-roadmap.md` within the L3 folder.
- **Next Steps for L2-T1:**
    - Proceed with tasks outlined in `l2-t1-roadmap.md` (if content were present; for now, it's a placeholder).
    - Integrate findings from L3-T1.

## 2025-06-02 UTC - Phase A Completion by AI Agent Jules

- **Status:** Phase A of `l2-t1-roadmap.md` completed.
- **Summary of Phase A Achievements:**
    - **Step A.1: Systematic Frontmatter Enrichment:** Processed 22 active atomic documents in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/`, aligning frontmatter with `MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER.md` and validating against controlled vocabularies.
    - **Step A.2: Systematic Deprecation Marking of Legacy Files:** Processed 24 legacy files in `/standards/` (root), updating frontmatter to `status/deprecated` and adding deprecation notices linking to new atomic standards.
    - **Step A.3: Full Standard Definition vs. Policy Document Content Review & Refinement:** Reviewed 6 pairs/groups (10 unique documents) in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` for correct HOW/WHERE vs. WHAT/WHEN/WHY content separation. (Based on a partial list from `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` due to `ls` truncation).
    - **Step A.4: Resolve Unmapped Placeholders & Populate Navigational Files:**
        - Created 4 new stub files for unresolved links (`CONCEPT-HYPOTHESIS-TESTING.md`, `CONCEPT-P-VALUE.md`, `CONCEPT-CORE-RESEARCH-METHODOLOGY.md`, `GUIDE-FEATURE-ADVANCED-SETTINGS.md`).
        - Fully populated the Table of Contents in `master-knowledge-base/standards/src/AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB.md`.
        - Created and populated the new `master-knowledge-base/AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER.MD` file.
- **Next Steps for L2-T1:**
    - Proceed with Phase B of `l2-t1-roadmap.md`: "Linter & Indexer Productionization & Initial Source Validation (within `/master-knowledge-base/`)".
    - Starting with "Step B.1: Productionize Linter (`kb_linter.py`)".
