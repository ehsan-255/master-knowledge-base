# Current State of Active Projects

This document provides a linear, chronological summary of major project initiations and completions within the `active-project/` directory. New entries are always appended to the end.

## 2025-06-01 19:43:27 UTC - Project Initiations & Status Update

*   **Refactoring Initiative (`active-project/-refactoring-initiative-active/`)**:
    *   **Status:** Active
    *   **Summary:** Project initiated to restructure existing project documents from `project-design/`, `project-planning/`, and `project-reports/` into the new standardized project format.
    *   Key analysis and roadmap documents (`master-analysis-report.md`, `master-roadmap.md`) have been established by consolidating original project definition files.
    *   The `master-progress.md` has been seeded from the root `./progress.md`.
    *   **Sub-task L2-T1 (`l2-t1-initial-refactoring-and-roadmap-phases-active/`)**: Active. Phase A (Metadata & Content Finalization) completed. Proceeding to Phase B (Tooling Productionization).
    *   **Sub-task L3-T1 (`l3-t1-phase-b-completion-completed/`)**: Completed. Analysis and roadmap documents established.

*   **Active Project Organization Initiative (`active-project/-active-project-organization-initiative-active/`)**:
    *   **Status:** Active
    *   **Summary:** Project initiated to formalize, document, and manage the standards for active project organization within this repository.
    *   The core definition document (`active-project/-active-project-organization-initiative-active/master-analysis-report.md`) has been moved to serve as this initiative's `master-analysis-report.md`.
    *   Placeholder `master-roadmap.md` and `master-progress.md` have been created.

## 2025-06-02 00:00:00 UTC - Project Completion Update

*   **Refactoring Initiative (`active-project/-refactoring-initiative-completed/`)**:
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Summary:** All phases (0-5) of the Standards Refactoring initiative, executed primarily through sub-task L2-T1 (Phases A-F), are now complete. This involved foundational definitions, atomic decomposition of standards, metadata enrichment, governance reviews, template finalization, implementation of derived views, productionization of automation tools (linter, indexer, builder), CI/CD setup, and comprehensive documentation updates.
    *   Key deliverables include a fully refactored `/standards/src/` directory, operational tools in `/tools/`, generated collections in `/dist/collections/`, and updated project management documents.
    *   **Sub-task L2-T1 (`l2-t1-initial-refactoring-and-roadmap-phases-completed/`)**: Completed. All phases (A-F) finished.
    *   **Outstanding Notes:**
        *   The `kb_linter.py` script exhibited a "local test mode" that prevented direct validation of some newly created/modified files during development. Full KB linting is handled by the CI pipeline.
        *   An issue with file access prevented direct modification of `standards/src/OM-AUTOMATION-LLM-IO-SCHEMAS.MD` to remove a broken link. This is noted in `project-reminders.md`.
    *   **Next Steps:** The entire `active-project/-refactoring-initiative-completed/` directory is now ready for archival to the `/archive/` directory as per project lifecycle guidelines.
