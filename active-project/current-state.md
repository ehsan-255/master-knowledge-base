# Current State of Active Projects

This document provides a linear, chronological summary of **TOP-LEVEL PROJECT STATUS CHANGES ONLY** within the `active-project/` directory. New entries are always appended to the end.

**SCOPE:** Documents only `-[project-name]-initiative-[status]` level changes. **DO NOT** log sub-task (`l[n]-sl[n]`) activities.

## 2025-06-19 00:00:00 UTC - Project Initiation
* **Audit Remediation Initiative**: INITIATED → PLANNED - Created to address five critical deficiencies in the standards ecosystem identified by recent audits.

## 2025-06-19 00:00:00 UTC - Status Change
* **Audit Remediation Initiative**: PLANNED → ACTIVE - Project work commenced with the generation of master analysis and roadmap documents.

## 2025-06-19 22:40:00 UTC - Progress Update
* **Audit Remediation Initiative**: ACTIVE - All five sub-level phases (invalid references, changelog metadata removal, draft-promotion process setup, architecture sync tool, and taxonomy correction) completed. Project ready for final review prior to archival.

## **MAINTENANCE GUIDE — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**

### **WHEN TO UPDATE:**
1. **PROJECT INITIATION**: When creating new `-[project-name]-initiative-planned/` folder
2. **STATUS TRANSITIONS**: When top-level project status changes (planned → active → completed/blocked/on-hold)
3. **PROJECT COMPLETION**: When moving completed projects to archive

### **UPDATE FORMAT:**
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC - [Event Type]
* **[Project Name]**: [OLD STATUS] → [NEW STATUS] - [1-2 sentence summary]
```

### **EXAMPLES:**
```markdown
## 2025-06-16 05:48:00 UTC - Project Initiation
* **API Redesign Initiative**: INITIATED - Restructure REST API architecture for improved performance

## 2025-06-16 10:30:00 UTC - Status Change  
* **API Redesign Initiative**: PLANNED → ACTIVE - Development work commenced on API redesign

## 2025-06-16 15:45:00 UTC - Project Completion
* **API Redesign Initiative**: ACTIVE → COMPLETED - All API endpoints redesigned and tested, ready for archival
```

### **STRICT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **UTC TIMESTAMPS ONLY**
- **1-2 SENTENCES MAXIMUM** per summary
- **TOP-LEVEL PROJECTS ONLY** (no sub-task logging)
- **APPEND CHRONOLOGICALLY** (newest at bottom)
- **CONSISTENT FORMAT** as shown in examples
