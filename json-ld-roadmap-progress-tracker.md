### **🚨 MANDATORY TIMESTAMP REQUIREMENTS**

#### **TIMESTAMP FORMAT**: **YYYYMMDD-HHMM** (NO DEVIATIONS ALLOWED)
- **Example**: 20241205-1430 (December 5, 2024 at 2:30 PM)
- **System Extraction**: ALWAYS extract current timestamp from system using terminal commands
- **Terminal Command**: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"` (use this exact format)
- **NO MANUAL TIMESTAMPS**: Never manually type timestamps - always extract from system

#### **DURATION CALCULATIONS**
- **Primary Unit**: Minutes (for tasks under 60 minutes)
- **Secondary Unit**: Hours (for tasks 1+ hours, format: "2.5 hours")  
- **Tertiary Unit**: Days (rarely used, format: "1.2 days")
- **NO TARGET DATES**: Focus on actual execution times only

---

### **🔄 CONTINUOUS EXECUTION PROTOCOL**

#### **AFTER EACH ITEM COMPLETION**
1. **Extract system timestamp** using terminal command
2. **Add completion entry** to appropriate log section
3. **Update timeline table** (Standard/Comprehensive only)
4. **Update metrics** (Standard/Comprehensive only)
5. **Keep entries brief** - focus on essential information only

#### **⛔ ONLY WHEN BLOCKED**
1. **Log issue** in Issue Tracking section
2. **Update item status** to BLOCKED in timeline
3. **Document resolution** when issue is resolved
4. **Extract resolution timestamp** from system

---

### **👍🏼 BEST PRACTICES**

- **Immediate updates** - log completion immediately after finishing an item
- **System timestamps** - never estimate or manually type timestamps. Always extract from system
- **Brief entries** - focus on outcomes and key points only
- **Issue focus** - only track significant blocking issues
- **Consistent format** - maintain template structure throughout execution

---

### **COORDINATION**
- **This progress tracker** is for detailed completion documentation
- **Checklist** is for quick status updates and brief notes
- **Main roadmap** remains the authoritative source for execution instructions

>**NO OTHER REPORTING, TRACKING, OR DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED FOR A ROADMAP**
