---

### **Entry 11**: **20250611-0103** | **STEP 3.1**: Enhance Graph Validator for Link Validation
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 3 minutes

#### **🎯 What Was Done**
Enhanced graph validator with comprehensive link validation functionality including internal link extraction, related-standards validation, and broken link detection

#### **📊 Outcome**

#### **💡 Notes**
PHASE 3 FULLY COMPLETED. Knowledge graph now fully connected with operational link validation and relationship generation. Ready for Phase 4 (SHACL validation).

---

### **Entry 13**: **[TIMESTAMP_4_1_COMPLETE]** | **TASK 4.1**: Create SHACL Shapes File
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 5 minutes

#### **🎯 What Was Done**
Created `standards/registry/shacl-shapes.ttl`. Defined `kb:CriticalDocumentShape` to enforce that documents with `kb:criticality "C4"` must have a `kb:lifecycle_gatekeeper`. Verified and corrected the `kb:` prefix URI to match `base.jsonld`.

#### **📊 Outcome**
`shacl-shapes.ttl` file is in place with the initial business rule for critical document validation. The `kb:` prefix is correctly set to `https://knowledge-base.local/vocab#`.

#### **💡 Notes**
Task completed as per subtask requirements. The file path and content are correct.

---

### **Entry 14**: **[TIMESTAMP_4_2_COMPLETE]** | **TASK 4.2**: Integrate SHACL Engine into Graph Validator
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 20 minutes (includes previous attempts and debugging of indexer for this effort)

#### **🎯 What Was Done**
1.  **Verified/Created Test Files**: Ensured `kb/tests/violating-shacl-doc.md` (missing `kb:lifecycle_gatekeeper` for C4) and `kb:tests/conforming-shacl-doc.md` (includes `kb:lifecycle_gatekeeper` for C4) were correctly defined.
2.  **Updated Master Index**: Ran `tools/indexer/generate_index.py` to ensure test files were included.
3.  **Ran Graph Validator**: Executed `tools/validators/graph_validator.py --output-report shacl-test-report.json`. The script now loads SHACL shapes from `standards/registry/shacl-shapes.ttl` and uses `pyshacl` to validate the graph.
4.  **Checked Output**: Confirmed that `shacl-test-report.json` (and console output interpretation) showed a "missing mandatory field: lifecycle_gatekeeper" for `kb:doc-violating-shacl-doc` and no such error for `kb:doc-conforming-shacl-doc`, indicating the SHACL rule was correctly applied.

#### **📊 Outcome**
The `graph_validator.py` now successfully integrates `pyshacl` for SHACL validation. Tests confirm that the `kb:CriticalDocumentShape` correctly identifies violations and passes conforming documents regarding the `kb:lifecycle_gatekeeper` requirement for "C4" criticality documents.

#### **💡 Notes**
This step also implicitly included successful completion of the previous subtask to refactor `tools/indexer/generate_index.py` to correctly parse all frontmatter fields. This refactoring was essential as the SHACL rules depend on accurate frontmatter data (like `kb:criticality`) being present in the `master-index.jsonld`. The test files `kb:doc-violating-shacl-doc` and `kb:doc-conforming-shacl-doc` had their frontmatter fully indexed, enabling the SHACL validation to work as expected on these nodes.

---

### **Entry 15**: **[TIMESTAMP_PH4_EXIT_VERIFIED]** | **PHASE 4 EXIT CONDITIONS**: Verification
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 1 minute

#### **🎯 What Was Done**
Verified both Phase 4 exit conditions:
1.  `standards/registry/shacl-shapes.ttl` exists and contains the `kb:CriticalDocumentShape` rule.
2.  The Graph Validator executes SHACL validation and correctly reports violations (TEST-SHACL-001 failed as expected) and conformance (TEST-SHACL-002 passed the specific shape as expected).

#### **📊 Outcome**
PHASE 4 FULLY COMPLETED. The system can automatically enforce complex business logic (via SHACL) across the entire knowledge graph. Ready to proceed to Phase 5.

#### **💡 Notes**
The SHACL validation infrastructure is now operational.

---

### **Entry 17**: **[TIMESTAMP_5_2_COMPLETE]** | **TASK 5.2**: Develop View Generator
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 25 minutes

#### **🎯 What Was Done**
Created `tools/view_generator.py` script capable of loading `schema-registry.jsonld` and `master-index.jsonld`. Implemented functionality to generate Markdown and YAML views for specified standard documents. Tested basic view generation to stdout and file, and error handling for non-existent IDs.

#### **📊 Outcome**
View generator can produce human-readable MD views (with field descriptions from schema) and structured YAML views (representing current state) for standard documents. This meets Phase 5, Condition 2 prerequisite.

#### **💡 Notes**
The script correctly uses `schema-registry.jsonld` to enrich the Markdown views with field descriptions.

## **📈 Session Progress Summary - [ACTUAL_SESSION_TIMESTAMP]**

**Overall Progress**: Significant progress made in Phase 5: Unifying the Toolchain & Formalizing Workflows.

**Step 5.1: Refactor the Naming Enforcer - COMPLETED**:
*   Analyzed existing `tools/naming-enforcer/naming_enforcer.py` and `standards/registry/schema-registry.jsonld`.
*   Enhanced `schema-registry.jsonld` by adding a `kb:namingConventions` section to explicitly define default file/directory patterns and common case style regexes (kebab-case, snake_case, etc.).
*   Refactored `naming_enforcer.py` to source these naming conventions directly from `schema-registry.jsonld`, removing its previous dependency on `GM-CONVENTIONS-NAMING.md` for these rules.
*   Successfully tested the refactored enforcer, confirming it applies schema-derived rules for file names, directory names, and frontmatter field keys.
*   Updated progress checklist and tracker for Step 5.1 completion.

**Step 5.2: Develop the View Generator - COMPLETED**:
*   Analyzed requirements for `tools/view_generator.py`.
*   Implemented `tools/view_generator.py`, enabling generation of human-readable Markdown views (including field descriptions from schema) and structured YAML views (representing current state for potential change requests) for standard documents.
*   Successfully tested the view generator's core functionality: MD and YAML output to stdout/file, and error handling.
*   Updated progress checklist and tracker for Step 5.2 completion.

**Step 5.3: Author the Workflow Standard - IN PROGRESS**:
*   Analyzed requirements for `OM-PROCESS-SST-UPDATE.md`, outlining key sections: Introduction, Roles, YAML Change Request Manifest format, detailed Update Process Steps (proposing, reviewing, applying, validating changes), and Versioning.

**Current State**: Ready to author the content for `OM-PROCESS-SST-UPDATE.md`.

**Immediate Next Steps (as per user directive for eventual commit)**:
1.  Complete authoring of `OM-PROCESS-SST-UPDATE.md` (Step 5.3).
2.  Verify all Phase 5 Exit Conditions.
3.  Update progress trackers for Step 5.3 and Phase 5 completion.
4.  Perform a thorough staging of all modified, untracked, and deleted files from Phase 5.
5.  Execute a commit operation with a refined, comprehensive commit message detailing Phase 5 completion.
6.  Prepare the local repository for upstream publication (push).
7.  Proceed to Phase 6: Full Orchestration with Scribe, starting with Step 6.1: Create Scribe Action Plugins.
