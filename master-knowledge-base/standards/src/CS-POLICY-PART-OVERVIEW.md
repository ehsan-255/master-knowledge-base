# Policy: Knowledge Base Part Overviews (CS-POLICY-PART-OVERVIEW)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy mandates that each "Part" (top-level primary section) of a Knowledge Base (KB), as defined in [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT]], MUST be introduced by a dedicated overview. The specific structural and content requirements for this overview (e.g., its filename `_overview.md` when Parts are folders, or its placement within `root.md` for smaller KBs, and its content including scope, purpose, and Table of Contents) are defined in [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART]].

## 2. Core Requirement

### Rule 2.1: Mandatory Overview for Each KB Part
Every "Part" within a Knowledge Base, whether implemented as a sub-folder or as a major section within the `root.md` file (see [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT]]), MUST have an associated overview document or section.
*   **Content and Structure:** The content, naming (e.g., `_overview.md`), and placement of this overview are governed by [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART]]. This includes:
    *   A brief explanation of the Part's scope and purpose.
    *   A linked Table of Contents (ToC) to its main sub-sections ("Chapters").
*   **Rationale:** Part overviews serve as clear entry points to major sections of a KB. They aid navigation by providing context and a roadmap to the content within that Part, helping users understand its structure and quickly locate relevant "Chapters."

## 3. Tool-Agnostic Nature of this Policy

This policy mandates the *existence* and *purpose* of the Part overview content as defined by [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART]].
*   **Display and Interaction:** How a Part overview (e.g., an `_overview.md` file acting as a "folder note") is displayed or interacted with (for instance, a feature where clicking a folder in a file tree opens its associated `_overview.md` note) is considered a tool-specific enhancement or feature of the authoring/publishing platform.
*   **Focus of this Policy:** This policy is concerned with the information architecture requirement that such an overview exists and fulfills its navigational and contextual purpose, regardless of specific tool features that might enhance its presentation. The structural standard [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART]] ensures the overview is discoverable and consistently named/placed.

## 4. Importance of Part Overviews

*   **Enhanced Navigability:** Provides users with a clear understanding of what each major section of the KB contains before they delve into individual "Chapters."
*   **Improved User Experience:** Reduces confusion and helps users orient themselves within the potentially large and complex structure of a KB.
*   **Content Discoverability:** The Table of Contents within each Part overview acts as a local guide, making it easier to discover all related content within that Part.
*   **Structural Clarity:** Reinforces the logical structure of the KB by providing a summary and entry point for each main thematic grouping of content.
*   **Authoring Consistency:** Ensures that all major sections of a KB are introduced in a uniform and helpful way.

## 5. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all Knowledge Bases and their constituent "Parts." All individuals involved in KB architecture, content creation, and curation are responsible for ensuring that Part overviews are created and maintained according to this policy and the referenced structural standards.

## 6. Cross-References
- [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART]] - Defines the specific structural and content requirements for Part overviews (e.g., `_overview.md` content).
- [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT]] - Defines how "Parts" are organized within a KB (as folders or sections in `root.md`).

*This policy (CS-POLICY-PART-OVERVIEW) mandates the use of Part Overviews, generalizing concepts previously associated with tool-specific features like Obsidian's folder notes (formerly U-USAGE-FOLDERS-NOTES-001) into a tool-agnostic architectural requirement.*
