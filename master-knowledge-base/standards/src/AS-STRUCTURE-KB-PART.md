# Standard: Knowledge Base Part Structure and Overview (AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART)

This standard defines the structural requirements for "Parts" (top-level primary sections) within a Knowledge Base (KB). It focuses on the mandatory overview that must introduce each Part, ensuring clarity and navigability.

## 1. Rules for "Part" Structure and Overview

### Rule 1.1: Mandatory Part Overview (Derived from U-STRUC-001, Rule 1.1)
Each "Part" (top-level primary section of a KB) MUST be fronted by an overview.
*   **Notes:** This overview serves as an entry point to the Part, guiding the user.

### Rule 1.2: Overview Location for Sub-folder Parts (Derived from U-STRUC-001, Rule 1.2)
If "Parts" are implemented as sub-folders (typically for larger KBs, as defined in [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT]]), the overview content MUST reside in an `_overview.md` file located directly within that Part's folder.
*   **Example:** `research-methodology-kb/part-i-foundations/_overview.md`
*   **Notes:** The filename `_overview.md` is mandatory and MUST adhere to naming conventions in [[SF-CONVENTIONS-NAMING]].

### Rule 1.3: Overview Location for `root.md` Section Parts (Derived from U-STRUC-001, Rule 1.3)
If "Parts" are implemented as major H1 sections within the `root.md` file (typically for smaller KBs, as defined in [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT]]), the overview content and links to its "Chapters" MUST directly follow the Part's H1 heading in `root.md`.
*   **Example (Structure within `root.md`):**
    ```markdown
    # Main KB Title

    ## Part I: First Major Section (H1 in this context)
    This part covers the foundational concepts... (This is the overview text)

    ### Chapters in this Part: (This is the ToC to chapters)
    - [Chapter 1: Introduction](./01-introduction.md)
    - [Chapter 2: Core Ideas](./02-core-ideas.md)
    ```
*   **Notes:** This ensures the overview is immediately accessible under the Part's heading.

### Rule 1.4: Content Requirements for Part Overview (Derived from U-STRUC-001, Rule 1.4)
The overview content for each Part (whether in `_overview.md` or within `root.md`) MUST:
    a.  Briefly explain the Part's scope, purpose, and the topics it covers.
    b.  Include a linked Table of Contents (ToC) to its main sub-sections, referred to as "Chapters."
*   **Notes:**
    *   Links in the ToC MUST use the syntax defined in [[SF-LINKS-INTERNAL-SYNTAX]].
    *   The overview text should be concise, typically 1-3 paragraphs.

## 2. Illustrative Example

### Snippet from `_overview.md` (for a Part implemented as a sub-folder)

File: `/research-methodology-kb/part-i-foundations/_overview.md`
```markdown
# Part I: Foundations of Research Methodology

This part lays the groundwork for understanding the core principles and initial stages of conducting formal research. It covers fundamental concepts, ethical considerations, and the importance of robust methodology.

## Chapters in this Part:
- [Chapter 1: Introduction to Research Methodology](./01-introduction-to-research-methodology.md)
- [Chapter 2: Core Concept of Research](./02-core-concept-of-research.md)
- [Chapter 3: Ethical Considerations in Research](./03-ethical-considerations.md)
```
*(Note: The example links above are illustrative path-based links. Per [[SF-LINKS-INTERNAL-SYNTAX]], these should ideally be `[[STANDARD_ID]]` or `[[FILENAME_ID_PLACEHOLDER]]` links once target IDs are defined and resolvable.)*
