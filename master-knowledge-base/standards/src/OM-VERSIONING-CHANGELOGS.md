# Standard: Versioning and Changelogs for Standard Files (OM-VERSIONING-CHANGELOGS)

This standard defines the mandatory requirements for versioning individual standard documents and maintaining their changelogs. Adherence to these rules ensures that changes to standards are tracked systematically, providing clarity on historical evolution and current validity.

## 1. Frontmatter Versioning Keys (Derived from U-VERSIONING-001, Rule 1.1)

Each individual standard document (including standard definitions, policies, guides, and schemas) MUST include the following keys in its YAML frontmatter, as defined in [[U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001_ID_PLACEHOLDER]]:

*   **`version`**: Specifies the current version of the standard document.
*   **`date-created`**: Specifies the date (and time) the standard document was initially created. This value SHOULD NOT change after initial creation.
*   **`date-modified`**: Specifies the date (and time) the standard document was last significantly modified. This MUST be updated upon every substantive change that also warrants a version increment.

*   **Notes:**
    *   The format for `date-created` and `date-modified` MUST be full ISO-8601 date-time format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`) as per [[U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001_ID_PLACEHOLDER]].
    *   The `version` key value MUST also be enclosed in single quotes in YAML (e.g., `version: '1.0.0'`) as specified in [[U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001_ID_PLACEHOLDER]].

## 2. Semantic Versioning (Derived from U-VERSIONING-001, Rule 1.2)

The `version` key for all standard documents MUST use Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (SemVer). The version number is formatted as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, `2.0.1`).

*   **Increment MAJOR version (e.g., `1.x.x` to `2.0.0`) when:**
    *   You make incompatible changes (breaking changes) to the standard that require consumers of the standard (e.g., documents, processes, tools) to adapt.
*   **Increment MINOR version (e.g., `x.1.x` to `x.2.0`) when:**
    *   You add functionality or rules in a backwards-compatible manner.
    *   You make significant clarifications or additions that do not break existing compatibility.
*   **Increment PATCH version (e.g., `x.x.1` to `x.x.2`) when:**
    *   You make backwards-compatible bug fixes, correct typos, or make minor editorial improvements that do not alter the substantive meaning or application of the standard.

*   **Initial Drafts:** Typically start at `0.1.0`.
*   **First Final Release:** Typically `1.0.0`.

*   **Example:**
    *   Initial draft: `version: '0.1.0'`
    *   First final release: `version: '1.0.0'`
    *   Minor clarification added: `version: '1.1.0'`
    *   Typo corrected: `version: '1.1.1'`
    *   Breaking change introduced: `version: '2.0.0'`

## 3. Changelog Maintenance (Derived from U-VERSIONING-001, Rule 1.3)

Each individual standard document MUST maintain a human-readable changelog. This changelog SHOULD be:

*   **Location Option 1 (Preferred for Atomic Standards):** A dedicated section within the standard document itself, typically an H2 or H3 heading titled "Changelog" or "Revision History" near the end of the document.
*   **Location Option 2 (Alternative):** A separate linked changelog file, referenced by the `change_log_url` frontmatter key as defined in [[U-METADATA-FRONTMATTER-RULES-001_ID_PLACEHOLDER]]. This is the approach this standard itself will follow (see its `change_log_url` frontmatter).

The changelog MUST record, at a minimum:
*   The **version number**.
*   The **date** of the change (corresponding to `date-modified`).
*   A **brief description** of the changes made for that version.

*   **Example (In-document Changelog Section):**
    ```markdown
    ## Changelog
    ### Version 1.1.0 (2024-07-15)
    - Clarified Rule 2.3 regarding SemVer incrementation.
    - Added examples for PATCH updates.

    ### Version 1.0.0 (2024-06-01)
    - Initial official release of the standard.

    ### Version 0.1.0 (2024-05-10)
    - Initial draft.
    ```

## 4. Rationale

*   **Traceability:** Semantic versioning and detailed changelogs provide a clear history of how a standard has evolved, making it easier to understand the rationale behind current rules.
*   **Impact Assessment:** When standards change, version numbers help users and maintainers assess the potential impact of adopting a new version.
*   **Communication:** Changelogs communicate the nature of updates to all stakeholders.
*   **Dependency Management:** In automated systems or when standards reference each other, versioning is critical for managing dependencies.

## 5. Cross-References
