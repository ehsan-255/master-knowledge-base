# Policy: Content Accessibility (CS-POLICY-ACCESSIBILITY)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy affirms the commitment to making all content within the Knowledge Base (KB) accessible to the widest possible audience, including individuals with disabilities. Adherence to accessibility standards is crucial for inclusivity, user experience, and legal compliance. This policy provides overarching principles, while specific technical standards (like those for image alt text or heading usage) provide detailed implementation rules.

## 2. Core Accessibility Principles and Requirements

### Rule 2.1: Commitment to Accessibility
All content creators, editors, and curators MUST strive to ensure that content meets recognized accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), to an appropriate level (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level AA as a target).
*   **Rationale:** Ensures a consistent and high-quality experience for all users, regardless of ability.

### Rule 2.2: Image Accessibility (Reference to Specific Standard)
All images that convey information MUST be made accessible through the provision of descriptive alternative text (alt text), as mandated by [[SF-ACCESSIBILITY-IMAGE-ALT-TEXT]].
*   **Summary of [[SF-ACCESSIBILITY-IMAGE-ALT-TEXT]]:**
    *   Informational images require descriptive alt text.
    *   Alt text must be concise yet convey the image's purpose and meaning.
    *   Purely decorative images should use empty alt text (`alt=""`) to be ignored by assistive technologies.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures that visually impaired users can understand the content and purpose of images.

### Rule 2.3: Semantic Use of Headings (Derived from U-ACCESSIBILITY-001, Rule 1.3)
Headings (H1-H6) MUST be used semantically to structure content logically and serve as navigational landmarks. They MUST be succinct and accurately reflect the content of the section they introduce.
*   **Guidance:**
    *   The H1 is reserved for the main document title.
    *   Subsequent headings (H2-H6) must follow a correct hierarchical order (e.g., an H2 followed by H3, not H4). Do not skip heading levels for styling purposes.
    *   Use headings to break up long blocks of text and clearly delineate topics and subtopics.
*   **Reference:** The specific Markdown syntax for headings is defined in [[SF-SYNTAX-HEADINGS]].
*   **Rationale:** Proper heading structure is critical for screen reader users, allowing them to navigate documents efficiently and understand their organization. It also benefits all users by making content more scannable and readable.

## 3. Future Expansion

This policy will be expanded over time to incorporate additional accessibility guidelines, which may include but are not limited to:

*   **Link Text Clarity:** Ensuring link text is descriptive and makes sense out of context.
*   **Color Contrast:** Guidelines for ensuring sufficient color contrast between text and background (if applicable to the platform or custom styling).
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensuring all interactive elements can be navigated using a keyboard.
*   **Accessible Tables:** Standards for structuring data tables for accessibility.
*   **Multimedia Accessibility:** Requirements for captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions for video and audio content.

## 4. Importance of Accessibility

*   **Inclusivity:** Provides equal access and opportunity to people with diverse abilities.
*   **User Experience:** Accessible design often results in a better user experience for everyone.
*   **Legal and Ethical Compliance:** Adherence to accessibility standards is often a legal requirement and an ethical imperative.
*   **Wider Audience Reach:** Makes content available to more people, including those with disabilities and those using a variety of devices or in different environments.

## 5. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all content within the Knowledge Base and to all individuals involved in its creation, editing, and maintenance.

## 6. Cross-References
- [[SF-ACCESSIBILITY-IMAGE-ALT-TEXT]] - Specific standard for image alt text.
- [[SF-SYNTAX-HEADINGS]] - Standard defining the syntax and semantic use of headings.

*This policy (CS-POLICY-ACCESSIBILITY) incorporates Rule 1.3 from U-ACCESSIBILITY-001 (regarding headings) and sets a general framework for content accessibility, referencing the specific standard created for image alt text.*
