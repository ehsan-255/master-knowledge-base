# Policy: Translating Non-Digital Concepts for Digital Workflows (CS-POLICY-DIGITAL-ABSTRACTION)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy provides guidelines for translating methodologies, techniques, or concepts that traditionally involve non-digital (physical, interpersonal, or ethically complex out-of-scope) components into a format suitable for a digitally-focused Knowledge Base (KB). The aim is to accurately represent the information-based aspects of such concepts while clearly delineating what is out of scope for the digital representation.

## 2. Core Principles for Digital Abstraction

### Rule 2.1: Explicit Exclusion or Abstraction of Non-Digital Aspects (Derived from U-ABSTR-DIGITAL-001, Rule 1.1)
When a methodology or concept traditionally involves physical real-world actions, direct interpersonal interactions, or ethically sensitive areas that are OUT OF SCOPE for the KB's digital and informational focus (as per [[CS-POLICY-SCOPE-INCLUSION]] and [[CS-POLICY-SCOPE-EXCLUSION]]), those aspects MUST be explicitly excluded or clearly abstracted.
*   **Example:** For a medical diagnostic procedure, a KB focused on data analysis would abstract the physical examination steps, focusing instead on the data inputs (symptoms, test results) and analytical processes. The physical examination itself would be noted as out of scope or handled abstractly (e.g., "patient data collected via standard examination protocols (out of scope for this document)").
*   **Rationale:** Maintains the KB's focus on digitally manageable information and processes, preventing scope creep into areas it's not designed to cover.

### Rule 2.2: Focus on Information-Based Processes (Derived from U-ABSTR-DIGITAL-001, Rule 1.2)
Abstracted methodologies or concepts MUST focus on the information-based processes, decision points, inputs, and outputs that *can* be executed, managed, or represented digitally.
*   **Example:** When abstracting a traditional face-to-face interview technique for a KB on qualitative data analysis:
    *   **Focus on:** Designing interview questions, structuring an interview protocol (as a digital document), methods for analyzing transcript data, coding qualitative data.
    *   **Abstract/Exclude:** The nuances of in-person rapport-building, non-verbal cues (unless a method for their digital capture and analysis is within scope).
*   **Guidance:** The goal is to capture the intellectual and procedural core of the concept that is relevant to the KB's purpose. This is particularly relevant for schemas like [[AS-SCHEMA-METHODOLOGY-DESCRIPTION]], where inputs and outputs of steps are defined.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures that the KB provides practical, actionable knowledge within its intended digital domain, even when dealing with concepts that have non-digital origins.

### Rule 2.3: Acknowledge Omission of Critical Out-of-Scope Steps (Derived from U-ABSTR-DIGITAL-001, Rule 1.3)
If a traditional step or component of a methodology is entirely out of scope for the digital abstraction, and its omission might lead to a misunderstanding of the abstracted version's context or limitations, its absence and the rationale for exclusion MUST be briefly noted.
*   **Example:** For a manufacturing quality control process, if physical inspection steps are excluded: "Note: This document focuses on the statistical analysis of quality data. Physical inspection and material handling procedures are out of scope and covered in separate operational manuals."
*   **Rationale:** Provides necessary context, manages user expectations, and prevents misapplication of the abstracted information by clarifying its boundaries.

## 3. Rationale and Importance

Adhering to this policy is important for several reasons:

*   **Maintaining KB Focus and Scope:** Prevents the KB from becoming overly broad or attempting to cover aspects beyond its intended digital and informational purpose.
*   **Ensuring Relevance:** Keeps content relevant to users seeking information that can be applied in a digital context or understood through information-based processes.
*   **Clarity and Accuracy:** Explicitly addressing abstractions and exclusions prevents misinterpretation and ensures the abstracted representation is understood in its proper context.
*   **Managing User Expectations:** Helps users understand what they can and cannot expect to find regarding methodologies that have significant non-digital components.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Provides a framework for responsibly handling concepts where certain aspects (e.g., sensitive interpersonal interactions, direct ethical interventions) are not suitable for full representation in the KB.

## 4. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all content creators and subject matter experts when documenting methodologies, techniques, processes, or concepts that originate from or include significant non-digital elements, and which are being adapted for inclusion in a Knowledge Base.
