# Standard: Table of Contents Syntax (Manual Creation) (SF-TOC-SYNTAX)

## 1. Standard Statement

This standard defines the mandatory Markdown syntax for manually creating a Table of Contents (ToC) within a document. A ToC provides an overview of the document's structure and allows readers to navigate directly to specific sections. While automated ToC generation is often preferred (see [[CS-TOC-POLICY_ID_PLACEHOLDER]]), this standard specifies the syntax to be used if a ToC is created or maintained manually.

## 2. Core Syntax Rules for Manual ToCs

### Rule 2.1: List Format
A manually created Table of Contents MUST be formatted as an unordered list, using hyphens (`-`) as markers, following the rules defined in [[SF-SYNTAX-LISTS_ID_PLACEHOLDER]].
*   **Rationale:** Unordered lists are the standard way to represent a collection of navigational links in Markdown.

### Rule 2.2: Internal Anchor Links
Each item in the ToC MUST be an internal link pointing to a specific heading within the same document. These links MUST use the standard Markdown anchor link format.
*   **Syntax:** `[Displayed Section Title](#actual-heading-id)`
    *   **`Displayed Section Title`**: The text that will be visible in the ToC (e.g., "2.1 My First Sub-section"). This should accurately reflect the heading text.
    *   **`#actual-heading-id`**: The anchor ID (slug) that the link points to. This ID is typically auto-generated by Markdown processors from the heading text.
        *   **ID Generation:** Most Markdown processors generate IDs by:
            1.  Converting the heading text to lowercase.
            2.  Replacing spaces with hyphens (`-`).
            3.  Removing or transliterating special characters (e.g., punctuation).
            4.  Ensuring uniqueness, possibly by appending `-1`, `-2`, etc., if multiple headings would generate the same ID.
        *   **Verification:** Authors creating manual ToCs MUST verify the exact anchor IDs generated by their Markdown processor/platform to ensure links work correctly. Inspecting the HTML output or using browser developer tools can help identify these IDs.
*   **Example:**
    ```markdown
    ## Table of Contents
    - [Introduction](#introduction)
    - [Main Section One](#main-section-one)
      - [Subsection A](#subsection-a)
      - [Subsection B](#subsection-b)
    - [Conclusion](#conclusion)
    ```
*   **Reference:** General link syntax is covered in [[SF-SYNTAX-LINKS-GENERAL_ID_PLACEHOLDER]].
*   **Rationale:** Standard anchor links are the universal method for in-document navigation in HTML, which is the common output format for Markdown.

### Rule 2.3: Representing Heading Hierarchy
Nested unordered lists SHOULD be used to represent the hierarchy of headings in the document.
*   **Guidance:** For example, H2 headings would be top-level list items in the ToC, H3 headings would be items in a nested list under the corresponding H2 item, and so on.
*   **Indentation:** Nesting MUST follow the indentation rules specified in [[SF-SYNTAX-LISTS_ID_PLACEHOLDER]] (typically 2 spaces per level).
*   **Example (Illustrating H2 and H3 levels):**
    ```markdown
    ## Table of Contents
    - [Chapter 1: Getting Started](#chapter-1-getting-started)
      - [1.1. Installation](#11-installation)
      - [1.2. Basic Configuration](#12-basic-configuration)
    - [Chapter 2: Advanced Features](#chapter-2-advanced-features)
      - [2.1. Feature X](#21-feature-x)
        - [2.1.1. Sub-feature Y](#211-sub-feature-y) 
    ```
*   **Rationale:** A nested ToC visually communicates the document's structure and the relationships between sections, improving navigability.

## 3. Placement

The Table of Contents, when manually created or included, is typically placed near the beginning of the document, often after the introductory abstract or summary. Specific placement requirements are governed by [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER_ID_PLACEHOLDER]].

## 4. Note on Automated ToC Generation

This standard specifically addresses the syntax for *manually created* Tables of Contents. The policy regarding the use of automated tools for ToC generation, and the requirement for their output to conform to this syntax, is detailed in [[CS-TOC-POLICY_ID_PLACEHOLDER]].

## 5. Importance of Correct ToC Syntax

*   **Navigability:** Provides users with a quick and easy way to jump to relevant sections of a document.
*   **Structural Overview:** Offers a clear outline of the document's content and organization.
*   **Authoring Consistency:** Ensures uniformity in how manual ToCs are created if automated methods are not used or are insufficient.
*   **Accessibility:** A well-structured ToC with descriptive links can aid users of assistive technologies.

## 6. Scope of Application

This standard applies to all Markdown documents within the knowledge base repository where a Table of Contents is created or maintained manually.
