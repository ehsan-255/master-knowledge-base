# Policy: Content Organization within Knowledge Base Parts (CS-POLICY-KB-PART-CONTENT)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy mandates that "Chapters" (individual documents or major H2 sections representing distinct topics) within a "Part" of a Knowledge Base (KB) are organized in a logical sequence and that each Chapter addresses a distinct, coherent topic. This ensures clarity, facilitates learning, and supports effective navigation.

## 2. Core Requirements

### Rule 2.1: Logical Sequencing of "Chapters" (Derived from U-STRUC-001, Rule 1.5)
"Chapters" within a "Part" of a Knowledge Base MUST be arranged in a logical sequence.
*   **Guidance:**
    *   The sequence should support a progressive understanding of the Part's subject matter. This might involve, for example, moving from foundational concepts to more advanced topics, or following a chronological or procedural order where appropriate.
    *   Sequencing is typically managed by numerical prefixes in filenames (e.g., `01-introduction.md`, `02-core-concepts.md`) as defined in [[SF-CONVENTIONS-NAMING]], or by the order of H2 headings if Chapters are sections within a single document (e.g., within `_overview.md` for a very small Part).
    *   The Table of Contents within the Part's overview (defined in [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART]]) MUST reflect this logical sequence.

### Rule 2.2: Distinct and Coherent Topic per "Chapter" (Derived from U-STRUC-001, Rule 1.6)
Each "Chapter" file or document (or H2 section if Chapters are not separate files) MUST address a distinct, coherent topic that aligns with the overall theme of the Part.
*   **Guidance:**
    *   A Chapter should have a clear focus and not attempt to cover too many disparate subjects.
    *   If a topic becomes too large or complex for a single Chapter, it should be broken down into multiple, more focused Chapters.
    *   The scope of each Chapter should be clearly articulated, often in its introductory section, as per [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER]].

## 3. Rationale and Importance

Adherence to this policy is vital for creating an effective and user-friendly knowledge base:

*   **Clarity and Understanding:** A logical flow of information helps users build knowledge progressively, making complex subjects easier to understand.
*   **Navigability:** Predictable sequencing allows users to easily find information and understand their current position within the broader context of a Part.
*   **Learning Pathways:** Well-structured Parts with logically sequenced Chapters create natural learning pathways for users wishing to master a subject.
*   **Information Architecture:** This policy supports a sound information architecture by ensuring that content is appropriately chunked and ordered.
*   **Maintainability:** Coherent, focused Chapters are easier to maintain, update, and refactor than overly broad or poorly organized content.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Presenting information in a structured, logical sequence reduces the cognitive load on users, allowing them to focus on understanding the content itself.

## 4. Scope of Application

This policy applies to the organization of "Chapters" within all "Parts" of all Knowledge Bases within the repository.

## 5. Cross-References
- [[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-PART]] - Defines the overall structure of KB Parts and their overviews.
- [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER]] - Standard for Content Document ("Chapter") Internal Structure (to be updated with actual ID).
- [[SF-CONVENTIONS-NAMING]] - File and Folder Naming Conventions (relevant for Chapter sequencing).

*This policy (CS-POLICY-KB-PART-CONTENT) is based on rules 1.5 and 1.6 previously defined in U-STRUC-001 from COL-ARCH-UNIVERSAL.md.*
