# Standard: Mandate for Standards Terminology Glossary (GM-MANDATE-STANDARDS-GLOSSARY)

## 1. Policy Statement

This standard mandates the creation and maintenance of a dedicated glossary for key terms used *within the standards documents themselves*. This glossary, identified as [[GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS]], is crucial for ensuring precise understanding and consistent interpretation of the terminology used across the entire standards ecosystem.

## 2. Core Requirements for the Standards Terminology Glossary

### Rule 2.1: Existence, Location, and Identification (Derived from U-GLOSSARY-001, Rule 1.1)
A dedicated glossary document, identified by the `standard_id` [[GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS]], MUST exist and be actively maintained.
*   **Content Focus:** This glossary MUST define key terms, jargon, abbreviations, and specific naming conventions (e.g., "atomic standard," "kebab-case," "schema," "frontmatter") that are used throughout the various standard documents. It is distinct from any KB-specific tag glossaries.
*   **Location:** This glossary document MUST reside at the path `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS.md`. (This path is specified based on the expected outcome of Step 2.3).
*   **Purpose:** To provide a single source of truth for the definitions of terms essential for understanding the standards themselves.

### Rule 2.2: Clarity of Definitions (Derived from U-GLOSSARY-001, Rule 1.2)
All terms included in the [[GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS]] document MUST be clearly, concisely, and unambiguously defined.
*   **Guidance:** Definitions should be easy to understand and should clarify the specific meaning of the term as it applies within the context of the standards. Examples may be included within the glossary to aid understanding.
*   **Rationale:** Clear definitions are fundamental to the utility of the glossary and prevent misinterpretation of standards.

## 3. Importance of the Standards Terminology Glossary

The mandated Standards Terminology Glossary is important for:

*   **Ensuring Consistent Understanding:** Provides a common reference point for all users, authors, and reviewers of standards, ensuring that terminology is interpreted consistently.
*   **Improving Clarity of Standards:** Well-defined terms make the standards documents themselves easier to read, understand, and apply correctly.
*   **Facilitating Onboarding:** Helps new team members or contributors quickly learn and understand the specific language used in the standards ecosystem.
*   **Supporting Standards Development:** Provides a controlled vocabulary for authors creating or updating standards, promoting consistency in new documentation.
*   **Reducing Ambiguity:** Minimizes the risk of misinterpretation that can arise from ambiguous or inconsistently used terminology.

## 4. Scope of Application

This standard applies to the governance body responsible for the knowledge base ecosystem, mandating the provision and maintenance of the [[GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS]] document. It also implicitly guides authors of standards to refer to and utilize this glossary.

## 5. Cross-References
- [[GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS]] - The actual glossary document whose existence and core content are mandated by this standard.
- [[CS-POLICY-TONE-LANGUAGE]] - Which emphasizes consistent use of terminology.

*This standard (GM-MANDATE-STANDARDS-GLOSSARY) is based on rules 1.1 and 1.2 previously defined in U-GLOSSARY-001 from COL-GOVERNANCE-UNIVERSAL.md, rephrasing them as mandates for the existence and content of the standards terminology glossary.*
