# Policy: Universal Principles for Content Exclusion (CS-POLICY-SCOPE-EXCLUSION)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy outlines the universal principles governing the exclusion of certain types of content from any Knowledge Base (KB). Adherence to these principles is mandatory to ensure legal compliance, uphold ethical standards, maintain data security, protect intellectual property, and preserve the quality, focus, and trustworthiness of the knowledge base.

## 2. Core Principles for Content Exclusion

### Rule 2.1: Prohibition of Illegal, Unethical, or Harmful Content (Derived from U-SCOPE-EXCLUDE-001, Rule 1.1)
Content that is illegal, unethical (by broad societal or organizational consensus), or promotes harm, discrimination, or violence MUST NOT be included in any Knowledge Base.
*   **Guidance:** This includes, but is not limited to, hate speech, incitement to violence, defamation, and content that violates applicable laws or regulations.
*   **Rationale:** Essential for legal compliance, ethical conduct, and maintaining a safe and respectful environment.

### Rule 2.2: Strict Control of Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (Derived from U-SCOPE-EXCLUDE-001, Rule 1.2)
Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) MUST NOT be included in publicly accessible or broadly available Knowledge Bases.
*   **Exception:** PII may only be included if explicitly mandated by the KB's secure design for specific, legitimate internal operational use, AND such inclusion is governed by strict access controls, data privacy policies, and relevant legal/regulatory compliance measures.
*   **Examples of PII to generally exclude:** Social Security numbers, private financial details, personal health information (unless in a specifically secured and compliant system), unmasked personal contact details of non-public figures.
*   **Rationale:** Protects individual privacy, ensures compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and prevents misuse of sensitive personal data.

### Rule 2.3: Respect for Intellectual Property (Derived from U-SCOPE-EXCLUDE-001, Rule 1.3)
Proprietary information, copyrighted material, or other intellectual property from third parties to which the organization does not hold explicit rights or a valid license for use and distribution within the KB MUST NOT be included.
*   **Guidance:** This includes verbatim copying of large text sections from copyrighted books, articles, or websites; use of unlicensed images, software code, or trade secrets.
*   **Alternative:** Instead of copying, summarize and cite the original source according to [[SF-FORMATTING-CITATIONS]].
*   **Rationale:** Ensures legal compliance with copyright laws and respects the intellectual property rights of others.

### Rule 2.4: Avoidance of Unnecessary Redundancy (Derived from U-SCOPE-EXCLUDE-001, Rule 1.4)
Redundant information that is already well-covered and adequately explained elsewhere within the *same Knowledge Base section or its direct conceptual hierarchy* MUST NOT be included if it does not add significant new value, perspective, or context.
*   **Guidance:**
    *   Prefer linking to the authoritative source of the information within the KB using [[SF-LINKS-INTERNAL-SYNTAX]].
    *   This rule does not prohibit summaries or syntheses that draw upon multiple sources to create new insights, but rather discourages simple repetition of existing content.
*   **Rationale:** Improves maintainability (updates only need to happen in one place), reduces KB clutter, and ensures users are directed to the most current and authoritative information on a topic.

## 3. Importance of These Exclusions

Strict adherence to these content exclusion principles is critical for:

*   **Legal and Regulatory Compliance:** Avoiding illegal content, PII breaches, and copyright infringement is fundamental to legal operation.
*   **Ethical Responsibility:** Upholding ethical standards in content ensures the KB is a responsible and trustworthy resource.
*   **Data Security and Privacy:** Protecting sensitive information is paramount.
*   **Maintaining Knowledge Base Quality and Focus:** Excluding irrelevant, harmful, or redundant information keeps the KB focused, reliable, and valuable.
*   **Building and Retaining User Trust:** Users must be confident that the KB content is legal, ethical, and respects privacy and intellectual property.
*   **Mitigating Risk:** Proactive exclusion of problematic content mitigates various organizational risks.

## 4. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all individuals involved in planning, creating, contributing, curating, or reviewing content for any Knowledge Base within the repository.
