# Policy: Table of Contents (ToC) Usage and Generation (CS-TOC-POLICY)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy defines requirements and recommendations for the inclusion, content, and generation of Tables of Contents (ToCs) within knowledge base documents. Effective ToCs are crucial for document navigation, providing users with an overview of the document's structure and direct access to its sections.

## 2. Core ToC Requirements and Recommendations

### Rule 2.1: ToC Mandate for "Chapter" Documents
As mandated by [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER_ID_PLACEHOLDER]] (Rule 1.3), all "Chapter" documents (primary content documents) MUST include a Table of Contents.
*   **Placement:** The ToC typically follows the introductory abstract, as specified in [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER_ID_PLACEHOLDER]].
*   **Rationale:** Essential for navigating longer content documents and understanding their structure at a glance.

### Rule 2.2: Content of ToC - Heading Levels
The Table of Contents SHOULD typically list all H2 and H3 headings within the document.
*   **Deeper Levels (H4-H6):** Inclusion of H4 and deeper heading levels in the ToC is OPTIONAL and should be determined by the document's length and complexity. If including deeper levels significantly clutters the ToC without adding substantial navigational value, they may be omitted.
*   **Rationale:** Provides a useful balance between detail and conciseness in the ToC. H2s and H3s usually represent the main sections and sub-sections that users will want to navigate to directly.

### Rule 2.3: No ToC Mandate for Atomic Standard Documents
Individual atomic standard documents (e.g., those located in `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` such as `SF-*.md`, `CS-*.md`, `AS-*.md`, `OM-*.md`, `GM-*.md`, `MT-*.md`) are NOT required to have an internal Table of Contents.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Atomic standard documents are typically shorter and more focused on a specific set of rules or a single concept. Their structure is usually evident from the main headings, and an internal ToC often provides limited additional navigational value for their typical length.
    *   The primary navigation for standards is intended to be through the Standards KB `root.md`, collection documents (which may be deprecated but linked from new navigational aids), and the relationships defined in their `related-standards` frontmatter.
*   **Exception:** Very long or complex standard documents MAY include a ToC if the author deems it beneficial for readability, but it is not a mandatory requirement for this `info-type`.

### Rule 2.4: Tooling for ToC Generation (Recommended)
While manual ToCs MUST follow the syntax defined in [[SF-TOC-SYNTAX]], the use of **automated tools or plugins to generate and maintain Tables of Contents is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** for "Chapter" documents and other longer content forms.
*   **Benefits of Automation:**
    *   **Accuracy:** Ensures ToC entries and links are always up-to-date with the document's headings, reducing the risk of broken links or outdated titles.
    *   **Efficiency:** Saves significant authoring and maintenance effort compared to manual ToC creation.
*   **Output Conformance:** The output generated by any automated ToC tool MUST conform to the syntax specified in [[SF-TOC-SYNTAX]] (i.e., standard Markdown unordered lists with internal anchor links). This ensures that the ToC is portable and correctly rendered even if the specific tool is not available in all environments.
*   **Tool-Agnostic Principle:** The choice of a specific ToC generation tool is secondary to the requirement that the generated ToC adheres to the defined Markdown syntax standard. Authors should select tools that produce compliant output.

## 3. Importance of ToC Policy

*   **Enhanced Document Navigation:** Allows users to quickly understand the structure of a document and jump to relevant sections.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Makes longer documents more accessible and less daunting to read.
*   **Authoring Efficiency (with Automation):** Reduces the manual effort required to create and maintain accurate ToCs.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures a consistent approach to ToC provision and formatting across the knowledge base.

## 4. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all documents within the knowledge base, particularly "Chapter" documents. It guides decisions on when a ToC is required, what it should contain, and how it should be generated.

## 5. Cross-References
- [[SF-TOC-SYNTAX]] - Defines the mandatory Markdown syntax for manually created ToCs (and the target output for automated tools).
- [[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER_ID_PLACEHOLDER]] - Mandates the inclusion of a ToC in "Chapter" documents and specifies its typical placement.

---
*This policy (CS-TOC-POLICY) generalizes previous mandates (like O-USAGE-TOC-MANDATE-001) and tool-specific recommendations (like O-USAGE-TOC-PLUGIN-001) into a tool-agnostic policy framework, emphasizing standard Markdown output for ToCs while recommending automation.*
