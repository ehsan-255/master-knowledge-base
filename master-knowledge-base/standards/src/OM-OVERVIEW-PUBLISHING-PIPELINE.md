# Standard: Publishing Pipeline Overview (OM-OVERVIEW-PUBLISHING-PIPELINE)

## 1. Standard Statement

This document provides a high-level overview of the publishing pipeline for the knowledge base (KB) ecosystem. The publishing pipeline encompasses the automated processes and steps involved in transforming source Markdown documents into a rendered, consumable format and deploying them to target platforms.

Understanding this pipeline is beneficial for authors, maintainers, and developers working within or contributing to the KB ecosystem.

## 2. Purpose of the Publishing Pipeline

The primary objectives of the publishing pipeline are to:
-   **Automate:** Reduce manual effort in content validation, processing, and deployment.
-   **Ensure Quality:** Integrate automated checks for metadata, links, and formatting.
-   **Standardize Output:** Produce a consistent, high-quality rendered version of the knowledge base(s).
-   **Enable Scalability:** Support the growth of content and the number of knowledge bases efficiently.
-   **Facilitate Different Views:** Generate various output formats or views if required (e.g., fully resolved text for LLMs, web-renderable HTML).

## 3. High-Level Stages

The publishing pipeline typically consists of the following logical stages. Specific implementations may vary in tooling and exact sequencing, but the general flow should align with these principles.

### 3.1. Source Control Trigger
-   **Description:** The pipeline is typically triggered by changes to the source content in the version control system (e.g., a push to the main branch of a knowledge base repository).
-   **Inputs:** Committed Markdown files and assets in `/master-knowledge-base/`.
-   **Key Activities:** Webhooks, repository polling.

### 3.2. Content Aggregation & Preparation (Optional)
-   **Description:** Depending on the KB structure, this stage might involve collecting content from multiple sources or KBs if a unified build is required.
-   **Inputs:** Source files from various locations.
-   **Key Activities:** Fetching remote repositories, copying files to a build environment.

### 3.3. Validation & Linting
-   **Description:** Automated checks are performed on the source content.
-   **Inputs:** Source Markdown files.
-   **Key Activities:**
    -   Metadata validation against `[[QM-VALIDATION-METADATA]]` (which uses `[[MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER]]`).
    -   Link checking (internal and external).
    -   Markdown linting (checking for syntax errors or style violations against `[[SF-FORMATTING-MARKDOWN-GENERAL]]` and other syntax standards).
    -   File hygiene checks (`[[SF-FORMATTING-FILE-HYGIENE]]`).
-   **Outputs:** Validation reports. Pipeline may halt on critical errors.

### 3.4. Content Processing & Rendering
-   **Description:** Source Markdown is transformed into a final, consumable format. This is where keyrefs are resolved, conditional content is processed, and transclusions are embedded.
-   **Inputs:** Validated source Markdown files, key definition files (e.g., `[[UA-KEYDEFS-GLOBAL]]`), conditional profiling attributes (`[[CS-CONTENT-PROFILING-POLICY]]`).
-   **Key Activities:**
    -   Keyref resolution.
    -   Conditional content processing (e.g., removing or including blocks based on attributes).
    -   Transclusion embedding.
    -   Conversion to HTML or other target formats (e.g., generating a fully resolved Markdown set for LLM ingestion as per `[[AS-KB-DIRECTORY-STRUCTURE]]`).
    -   Table of Contents generation.
-   **Outputs:** Rendered content in the target format(s) (e.g., HTML files, resolved Markdown files in `/master-knowledge-base-rendered/`).

### 3.5. Asset Management
-   **Description:** Processing and optimization of static assets (images, diagrams, attachments).
-   **Inputs:** Source assets from `assets/` directories.
-   **Key Activities:** Image optimization, copying assets to appropriate locations in the rendered output.
-   **Outputs:** Optimized assets in the deployment package.

### 3.6. Deployment
-   **Description:** The rendered content and assets are deployed to the target platform(s).
-   **Inputs:** Rendered content, processed assets.
-   **Key Activities:** Uploading files to web servers, content delivery networks (CDNs), or other content repositories. Invalidating caches.
-   **Outputs:** Published knowledge base accessible to end-users.

### 3.7. Post-Deployment Verification (Optional)
-   **Description:** Automated checks on the deployed site or content.
-   **Key Activities:** Smoke tests, link checking on the live site.
-   **Outputs:** Verification reports. Alerts on critical deployment issues.

## 4. Key Technologies and Principles
-   **Automation Servers:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, or similar.
-   **Scripting:** Python, Shell scripts, or other languages for custom processing logic.
-   **Configuration as Code:** Pipeline definitions should be stored in version control.
-   **Idempotency:** Pipeline stages should be designed to be runnable multiple times with the same result if possible.
-   **Error Handling & Logging:** Robust error handling and comprehensive logging are essential at each stage.

## 5. Further Details
This document provides a high-level overview. More detailed standards or operational guides may exist for specific components or technologies used within the pipeline. For example, data exchange with LLM services involved in any pipeline step would adhere to `[[UA-SCHEMA-LLM-IO]]`.

## 6. Scope of Application
This overview is intended for all stakeholders involved in the creation, management, and consumption of knowledge base content, to provide a common understanding of how content transitions from source to a published state.
