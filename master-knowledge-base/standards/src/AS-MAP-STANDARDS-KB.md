# Standards Knowledge Base Definition Map (AS-MAP-STANDARDS-KB)

## 1. Standard Statement

This document defines the logical structure, primary parts (categories), and overall organization of the Standards Knowledge Base (KB) itself. It serves as a high-level map to help users navigate and understand the layout and content of the standards documentation.

The Standards KB is the authoritative source for all standards, policies, and guidelines governing the creation, management, and use of all knowledge bases within the ecosystem.

> [!TODO] The content of this document, particularly the `parts` structure in the frontmatter and the detailed descriptions below, needs to be fully populated and aligned with the actual organization of standards within the `/master-knowledge-base/standards/src/` directory. The current content is a high-level placeholder based on primary domains.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this KB Definition Map is to:
-   Provide a clear and organized overview of the Standards KB.
-   Define the main logical sections ("Parts") of the Standards KB.
-   Facilitate navigation and discovery of relevant standards.
-   Serve as a reference for authors contributing to the Standards KB.

## 3. Structure of the Standards Knowledge Base

The Standards Knowledge Base is organized into logical "Parts," primarily aligned with the `primary_domain` codes used in `standard_id`s. Each part groups related standards.

*(The detailed structure, including links to overview documents for each part and key standards within each part, would be elaborated here. The frontmatter `kb_definition` field provides a conceptual outline of this structure.)*

### Example Part Outline (derived from frontmatter `kb_definition`):

#### Part 1: Architecture and Structure (AS)
-   **Overview:** Standards defining the overall organization of knowledge bases, individual documents, and metadata structures.
-   **Key Documents:** (List or link to key `AS-*` standards, e.g., `[[AS-STRUCTURE-KB-ROOT]]`, `[[AS-STRUCTURE-DOC-CHAPTER]]`, `[[MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER]]` (as it defines a core structure), etc.)

#### Part 2: Content Style and Policies (CS)
-   **Overview:** Standards and policies related to content authoring, tone, language, presentation, and accessibility.
-   **Key Documents:** (List or link to key `CS-*` standards)

#### Part 3: General Management and Meta (GM)
-   **Overview:** Guidance documents, glossaries, and policies for overall KB management, user onboarding, and understanding the standards ecosystem.
-   **Key Documents:** (List or link to key `GM-*` standards, e.g., `[[GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE]]`, `[[GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS]]`)

#### Part 4: Metadata, Tagging, and Registries (MT)
-   **Overview:** Standards for document metadata (frontmatter), tagging strategies, keyref systems, and the governance of controlled vocabularies (registries).
-   **Key Documents:** (List or link to key `MT-*` standards, e.g., `[[MT-SCHEMA-FRONTMATTER]]`, `[[MT-TAGGING-STRATEGY-POLICY]]`, `[[MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY]]`)

#### Part 5: Operational Management and Lifecycles (OM)
-   **Overview:** Policies and procedures for the operational aspects of standards and content, including governance, versioning, deprecation, and publishing pipelines.
-   **Key Documents:** (List or link to key `OM-*` standards, e.g., `[[OM-POLICY-STANDARDS-GOVERNANCE]]`, `[[OM-OVERVIEW-PUBLISHING-PIPELINE]]`)

#### Part 6: Quality, Metrics, and Validation (QM)
-   **Overview:** Standards and procedures related to ensuring content quality, defining metrics, and validating metadata and content against defined rules.
-   **Key Documents:** (List or link to key `QM-*` standards, e.g., `[[QM-VALIDATION-METADATA]]`)

#### Part 7: Syntax, Formatting, and Conventions (SF)
-   **Overview:** Specific rules for Markdown syntax, file formatting, naming conventions, and other presentational aspects of content.
-   **Key Documents:** (List or link to key `SF-*` standards, e.g., `[[SF-FORMATTING-MARKDOWN-GENERAL]]`, `[[SF-CONVENTIONS-NAMING]]`)

#### Part 8: Utility, Assets, and Automation (UA)
-   **Overview:** Standards for supporting utilities (like keyrefs), management of assets (like images), and schemas for automation processes (like LLM I/O).
-   **Key Documents:** (List or link to key `UA-*` standards, e.g., `[[UA-KEYDEFS-GLOBAL]]`, `[[UA-SCHEMA-LLM-IO]]`)

## 4. Navigation
-   The primary entry point for the Standards KB is typically its `root.md` file.
-   The master directory of all KBs is `[[AS-STRUCTURE-MASTER-KB-INDEX]]`.

This map helps provide a structured view into the comprehensive set of standards governing the knowledge ecosystem.
