# Policy: Clarity, Objectivity, and Consistency in Language (CS-POLICY-TONE-LANGUAGE)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy establishes the standards for language, tone, and style to be used in all written content within the knowledge base. Adherence to these standards is essential for ensuring clarity, promoting user understanding, maintaining objectivity, and achieving consistency across all documents.

## 2. Core Language and Tone Requirements

### Rule 2.1: Clarity, Conciseness, and Precision (Derived from U-TONE-LANG-001, Rule 1.1)
All language used MUST be clear, concise, precise, and unambiguous. Overly complex sentence structures, jargon where simpler terms suffice, and verbose phrasing MUST be avoided.
*   **Example:** Prefer "The method involves..." over "It is the case that the method, in its fundamental aspects, necessitates..."
*   **Rationale:** Clear and direct language reduces ambiguity, improves reader comprehension, and makes information more accessible to a wider audience, including those for whom the language may be a second language or who are new to the subject matter.

### Rule 2.2: Objective and Informative Tone (Derived from U-TONE-LANG-001, Rule 1.2)
The tone of content MUST be objective, academic (where appropriate to the subject), and informative. Overly informal language, expressions of personal opinion (unless explicitly framed as such and necessary for context, e.g., an "Expert Opinion" section), or persuasive language MUST NOT be used as the default style.
*   **Guidance:** The primary goal is to inform and explain, not to entertain or persuade, unless the specific purpose of a document (e.g., a vision statement) explicitly calls for a different tone.
*   **Rationale:** An objective tone builds trust and credibility. It ensures that the information is presented factually, allowing users to form their own conclusions.

### Rule 2.3: Consistent Use of Terminology (Derived from U-TONE-LANG-001, Rule 1.3)
Terminology specific to a domain or subject MUST be used consistently throughout all related documents. If a term has multiple meanings, the intended meaning MUST be clarified upon its first use within a document, or the term should be linked to its definition in a relevant glossary (e.g., [[GM-GLOSSARY-STANDARDS-TERMS]]).
*   **Example:** If "Systematic Review" is chosen as the standard term, it should be used consistently instead of interchanging it with "structured review" or "comprehensive literature survey" without clarification.
*   **Rationale:** Consistent terminology prevents confusion and ensures that all readers share a common understanding of key terms. This is vital for precise communication, especially in technical or specialized fields.

### Rule 2.4: Definition of Acronyms and Abbreviations (Derived from U-TONE-LANG-001, Rule 1.4)
Acronyms and abbreviations MUST be defined upon their first use in any given document. The full term should be written out, followed by the acronym or abbreviation in parentheses. Subsequently, the acronym or abbreviation can be used.
*   **Example:** "This document adheres to the Knowledge Base (KB) standards. The KB provides..."
*   **Exception:** Widely understood universal acronyms (e.g., HTML, API in a technical KB) may not require definition in every document, but when in doubt, define.
*   **Rationale:** Defining acronyms ensures that all readers, regardless of their familiarity with the subject, can understand the terminology used. It avoids ambiguity and improves readability.

### Rule 2.5: Preference for Active Voice (Derived from U-TONE-LANG-001, Rule 1.5)
Active voice MUST be used more frequently than passive voice where appropriate, especially for clarity and directness in instructional or procedural content.
*   **Example:** Prefer "The linter checks the frontmatter." over "The frontmatter is checked by the linter."
*   **Guidance:** While passive voice has its uses (e.g., when the agent performing an action is unknown or unimportant), active voice generally makes sentences more direct, easier to understand, and more engaging.
*   **Rationale:** Active voice clearly identifies the actor performing an action, which can be crucial for understanding processes or responsibilities. It often results in shorter, more impactful sentences.

## 3. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all textual content within all Knowledge Bases, including but not limited to:
*   Standard and policy documents
*   Guides and instructional materials
*   Descriptive texts within schemas and templates
*   Content of `primary-topic`, `scope_application`, and similar metadata fields
