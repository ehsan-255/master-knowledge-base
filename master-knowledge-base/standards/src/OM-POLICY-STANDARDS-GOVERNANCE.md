# Policy: Governance for Proposing and Updating Standards (OM-POLICY-STANDARDS-GOVERNANCE)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy establishes the governance framework for proposing, reviewing, updating, and managing standards within the knowledge base ecosystem. A defined governance process is essential for maintaining the quality, consistency, relevance, and integrity of all standard documents.

## 2. Core Governance Requirements

### Rule 2.1: Documented Proposal and Change Process (Derived from U-GOVERNANCE-001, Rule 1.1)
A defined and documented process for proposing new standards or initiating changes to existing standards MUST be established and maintained.
*   **Guidance:** This process should be clearly outlined in a readily accessible location, such as the primary "How to Use These Standards" guide (expected to be [[GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE]]) or a dedicated governance document. The process should specify how proposals are submitted (e.g., issue tracker, formal document submission), what information a proposal must contain, and the initial steps for consideration.
*   **Importance:** A documented process ensures transparency and provides a clear pathway for all stakeholders to contribute to the evolution of standards. It prevents ad-hoc changes and promotes systematic development.

### Rule 2.2: Mandatory Review Process (Derived from U-GOVERNANCE-001, Rule 1.2)
All proposed new standards and any proposed substantive changes to existing standards MUST undergo a formal review process before being approved and incorporated into the official set of standards.
*   **Guidance:** The nature of the review process (e.g., peer review, subject matter expert (SME) consultation, editorial board review, public comment period) should be defined as part of the documented governance process (see Rule 2.1). The review should assess the proposal's clarity, necessity, impact, consistency with existing standards, and feasibility.
*   **Importance:** A mandatory review process acts as a quality control mechanism, ensuring that standards are well-vetted, technically sound, and align with the overall goals of the knowledge base before they become official.

### Rule 2.3: Prompt Updates to Registries and Navigational Aids (Derived from U-GOVERNANCE-001, Rule 1.3)
Upon the addition, significant modification, or deprecation of any standard, all relevant registries and navigational aids MUST be updated promptly.
*   **Guidance:** This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   The Tag Glossary (expected to be [[MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY]]) if tags are added, changed, or deprecated as part of the standard's lifecycle.
    *   Any master Table of Contents documents, such as `kb-directory.md` or collection documents (e.g., `COL-ARCH-UNIVERSAL.md` before its deprecation).
    *   Automated indices or search databases.
*   **Importance:** Keeping registries and navigational aids up-to-date is crucial for maintaining the consistency, discoverability, and usability of the standards ecosystem. Outdated information can lead to confusion and hinder the effective application of standards.

## 3. Rationale for Governance

A formal governance process for standards offers several key benefits:

*   **Quality Assurance:** Ensures standards are accurate, clear, and fit for purpose through structured review and approval.
*   **Consistency:** Helps maintain consistency across different standards and prevents conflicting rules.
*   **Transparency:** Provides visibility into how standards are developed, changed, and managed.
*   **Stakeholder Buy-in:** Involving stakeholders in the proposal and review process can increase understanding and adoption of standards.
*   **Controlled Evolution:** Allows the standards ecosystem to evolve in a controlled and thoughtful manner, adapting to new needs while preserving stability.
*   **Risk Management:** Reduces the risk of poorly conceived or implemented standards causing disruption or confusion.

## 4. Scope of Application

This policy applies to all standard documents within the knowledge base ecosystem and to all individuals or groups involved in their creation, maintenance, and management.

## 5. Cross-References
- [[GM-GUIDE-KB-USAGE]] - Expected location for detailed procedures on proposing and updating standards.
- [[MT-REGISTRY-TAG-GLOSSARY]] - For definitions of tags used in standards, which must be kept current.
- [[OM-VERSIONING-CHANGELOGS]] - Defines how changes to standards are versioned and logged.
- [[OM-POLICY-STANDARDS-DEPRECATION]] - Policy for deprecating standards, which is part of the governance lifecycle.
