# Standards Changelog

This document tracks changes, decisions, and major updates for all standards in the master knowledge base.

## Version 1.0.0 (2025-01-11)

**MAJOR RESTRUCTURE: Individual to Folder-Level Changelogs**

### Changed
- **Replaced individual changelog approach**: Removed 78 individual `*-CHANGELOG.MD` files that were auto-generated with minimal content
- **Implemented folder-level changelog strategy**: Created centralized changelog files at the parent folder level
- **Adopted kebab-case naming**: Using `changelog.md` instead of `CHANGELOG.MD` to follow standard file naming conventions

### Rationale
- **Maintainability**: Managing 2 changelog files instead of 78+ individual files
- **Meaningful Granularity**: Changes often affect multiple standards cross-cutting the entire standards domain
- **Compliance with OM-VERSIONING-CHANGELOGS**: Standard allows separate changelog files, folder-level is appropriate scope
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Removed auto-generated placeholder files that provided no value

### Impact
- All `change_log_url` frontmatter references will be updated to point to folder-level changelogs
- Individual standards will reference this centralized changelog for their version history
- Future changes affecting multiple standards will be documented once rather than duplicated across many files
