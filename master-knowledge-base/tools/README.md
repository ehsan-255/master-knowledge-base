# Master Knowledge Base Tools (`master-knowledge-base/tools/`)

This directory contains various scripts and tools used for maintaining, validating, processing, and building the Master Knowledge Base and its associated standards.

## Purpose

The tools within this directory serve multiple functions:
- **Validation & Linting:** Ensuring content adheres to defined standards, schemas, and formatting rules.
- **Indexing & Data Generation:** Creating machine-readable indexes of standards and other derived data.
- **Content Refactoring:** Assisting with bulk updates or corrections to content and frontmatter.
- **File Management & Utilities:** Providing utilities for tasks like file format conversion or specific content population.
- **Building Derived Views:** Aggregating atomic content into collection documents.
- **Reporting:** Storing output reports from various tools (e.g., linter reports).

## Directory Structure

The `tools/` directory is organized into the following main subdirectories:

-   **`builder/`**: Contains scripts for building derived views or collections from atomic standards (e.g., `generate_collections.py`).
-   **`file-format-utils/`**: Utilities for file format conversions or checks (e.g., `crlf_to_lf_converter.py` for line endings).
-   **`frontmatter-management/`**: Scripts specifically designed to manage or populate YAML frontmatter in content files (e.g., `populate-changelog-fm/` for changelog frontmatter).
-   **`indexer/`**: Contains the script (`generate_index.py`) responsible for creating the `standards_index.json` file, which is a catalog of all standards.
-   **`linter/`**: Houses the main knowledge base linter (`kb_linter.py`), used to validate Markdown files against project standards.
-   **`refactoring-scripts/`**: A collection of utility scripts for performing specific refactoring tasks on content or frontmatter (e.g., updating ID casing, tag formats, link structures).
-   **`reports/`**: The designated directory for storing output reports generated by tools, particularly the linter.
-   **`validators/`**: Scripts used for validating specific data structures or files against schemas (e.g., `validate_registry.py` for YAML registry files).

Please refer to the `README.md` file within each subdirectory (if present) for more detailed information about the specific tools it contains.
