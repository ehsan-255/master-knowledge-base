# Master Index of Knowledge Bases (AS-INDEX-KB-MASTER)

This document serves as a centralized directory of all distinct Knowledge Bases (KBs) within our information ecosystem. Each KB is a self-contained unit focused on a specific domain, product, or area of knowledge.

## Registered Knowledge Bases

The following Knowledge Bases are currently part of the managed ecosystem:

-   **[Standards Development Knowledge Base]([[AS-ROOT-STANDARDS-KB]])**: Contains all standards, policies, and guidelines for creating, managing, and governing content within the knowledge ecosystem.

-   **(Illustrative Example) Product X Knowledge Base**: Documentation, guides, and troubleshooting for Product X. *(Note: Link would be to the root of Product X KB if it exists)*

-   **(Illustrative Example) Research & Development Insights KB**: Internal findings, experiment results, and innovation tracking for R&D teams. *(Note: Link would be to the root of R&D KB if it exists)*

To propose the addition of a new Knowledge Base to this index, please follow the process outlined in `[[OM-POLICY-KB-REGISTRATION]]` (once created).
