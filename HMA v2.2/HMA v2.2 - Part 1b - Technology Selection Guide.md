# Hexagonal Microkernel Architecture (HMA) Specification
_Version 2.2 (Guided Implementation Edition)_

**Part 1b: Technology Selection Guide (NEW in v2.2)**

This part provides comprehensive guidance for selecting technologies within the HMA ecosystem. It establishes the three-tier framework that balances proven reliability with innovation flexibility, helping teams make informed technology decisions while maintaining ecosystem compatibility.

## 1. Guided Flexibility Framework

### 1.1 Three-Tier Technology Guidance

HMA v2.2 introduces a structured approach to technology selection through three distinct tiers:

#### **Tier 1: MANDATORY (Interoperability Standards)**
- **Purpose:** Ensure ecosystem-wide compatibility and interoperability
- **Requirement Level:** MUST use - non-negotiable for HMA compliance
- **Scope:** All external boundaries and core contracts
- **Evolution:** Changes require major version increment and ecosystem coordination

#### **Tier 2: RECOMMENDED (Proven Solutions)**
- **Purpose:** Provide battle-tested, community-validated technology choices
- **Requirement Level:** SHOULD use unless justified otherwise
- **Scope:** Internal implementations, infrastructure, and operational tooling
- **Evolution:** Regular updates based on community adoption and innovation

#### **Tier 3: ALTERNATIVE (Specialized Needs)**
- **Purpose:** Enable optimization for specific domains and advanced requirements
- **Requirement Level:** MAY use with proper documentation and compliance
- **Scope:** Domain-specific optimizations and cutting-edge innovations
- **Evolution:** Successful alternatives can be promoted to Tier 2
