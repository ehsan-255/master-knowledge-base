⬜ **🏁 PHASE 5 EXIT CONDITIONS**: The toolchain is unified, and the human/AI update process is formally governed.
⬜ **CONDITION 1**: The Naming Enforcer operates solely based on rules from `schema-registry.jsonld`.
- *Note: [🔤]*
⬜ **CONDITION 2**: The View Generator can produce both `.md` and `.yaml` views from the SSTs.
- *Note: [🔤]*
⬜ **CONDITION 3**: The `OM-PROCESS-SST-UPDATE.md` standard is authored and approved.

## STATUS LEGEND

⬜ **NOT STARTED**
🔄 **IN PROGRESS**
✅ **COMPLETED**
❌ **BLOCKED**
*Note: [🔤]* **ONE-LINER NOTE PLACEHOLDER: REPLACE 🔤 WITH A ONE-LINER NOTE *ONLY IF NEEDED*, OTHERWISE DELETE THE WHOLE PLACEHOLDER**

**NOTE:** ***🔄 IN PROGRESS and ❌ BLOCKED statuses must be applied to all the affected parent branches all the way up to the project level***

---

## CHECKLIST USAGE PROTOCOL

### **STATUS TRACKING**
- **Update checkboxes** continuously during execution **at all times**
- **Add one-liner notes** *only* for important execution points, decisions, or issues. *NOT REQUIRED; ADD ONLY IF NEEDED*
- **Apply cascading status** to parent branches when items are blocked or in progress
- **Reference main roadmap** for detailed instructions and context

### **NOTE MANAGEMENT**
- **NOTES ARE NOT REQUIRED; ADD ONLY FOR VERY IMPORTANT EXECUTION POINTS, DECISIONS, OR ISSUES**
- **Replace 🔤 with a one-liner note *only if needed*, otherwise delete the whole placeholder**
- **Keep notes brief** - maximum 1-2 lines per item
- **Focus on execution highlights** - important decisions, issues, changes, outcomes
- **Use timestamps** when helpful for critical notes
- **Avoid duplicating** information already in progress tracker

### **COORDINATION**
- **This checklist** is for quick status updates and brief notes
- **Progress tracker** is for detailed completion documentation
- **Main roadmap** remains the authoritative source for execution instructions

>**NO OTHER REPORTING, TRACKING, OR DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED FOR A ROADMAP**
