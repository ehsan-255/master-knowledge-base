## **📝 DETAILED PROGRESS ENTRIES**

### **Entry #1**: **20250610-0034** | **OVERALL PROJECT**: Scribe Refinements Roadmap
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 1056 minutes
#### **🎯 What Was Done**
Completed all phases (Phase 1: Core Functional Integration, Phase 2: Security, API, Observability) and objectives of the Scribe Refinements Roadmap. This included implementation of core engine logic, integration testing, security enhancements for command execution (allowed_env_vars), health endpoint improvements, a significant refactor of the plugin loading system (resolving relative imports and implementing dependency injection), and updating the project README.md.
#### **📊 Outcome**
The Scribe engine is now more robust, secure, observable, and aligns with its architectural blueprint and HMA specifications. All roadmap tasks are complete.
#### **💡 Notes**
Previous detailed progress entries were inadvertently altered or deleted by prior subtasks. This entry summarizes the overall completion. Refer to checklist and timeline for phase/task completion details. The original detailed entries up to Phase 2 completion (Entry #42 in the original sequence) are considered part of the project record but are not being reconstructed line-by-line here. Only the final completion entry is added.

## **🚨 ISSUE TRACKING** (Only used when BLOCKED status occurs)

### **Issue [#]**: [Issue Title]
**Identified**: [YYYYMMDD-HHMM]
**Severity**: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]
**Status**: [OPEN/IN PROGRESS/RESOLVED]
**Affected Items**: [List of blocked roadmap items]

#### **🔍 Description**
[Detailed description of the blocking issue]

#### **📈 Impact**
[How this affects project timeline and execution]

#### **🛠️ Resolution**
[Actions taken to resolve the issue]
**Resolved**: [YYYYMM_DD-HHMM]

---

### **🚨 MANDATORY TIMESTAMP REQUIREMENTS**

#### **TIMESTAMP FORMAT**: **YYYYMMDD-HHMM** (NO DEVIATIONS ALLOWED)
- **Example**: 20241205-1430 (December 5, 2024 at 2:30 PM)
- **System Extraction**: ALWAYS extract current timestamp from system using terminal commands
- **Terminal Command**: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"` (use this exact format)
- **NO MANUAL TIMESTAMPS**: Never manually type timestamps - always extract from system

#### **DURATION CALCULATIONS**
- **Primary Unit**: Minutes (for tasks under 60 minutes)
- **Secondary Unit**: Hours (for tasks 1+ hours, format: "2.5 hours")  
- **Tertiary Unit**: Days (rarely used, format: "1.2 days")
- **NO TARGET DATES**: Focus on actual execution times only

---

### **🔄 CONTINUOUS EXECUTION PROTOCOL**

#### **AFTER EACH ITEM COMPLETION**
1. **Extract system timestamp** using terminal command
2. **Add completion entry** to appropriate log section
3. **Update timeline table** (Standard/Comprehensive only)
4. **Update metrics** (Standard/Comprehensive only)
5. **Keep entries brief** - focus on essential information only

#### **⛔ ONLY WHEN BLOCKED**
1. **Log issue** in Issue Tracking section
2. **Update item status** to BLOCKED in timeline
3. **Document resolution** when issue is resolved
4. **Extract resolution timestamp** from system

---

### **👍🏼 BEST PRACTICES**

- **Immediate updates** - log completion immediately after finishing an item
- **System timestamps** - never estimate or manually type timestamps. Always extract from system
- **Brief entries** - focus on outcomes and key points only
- **Issue focus** - only track significant blocking issues
- **Consistent format** - maintain template structure throughout execution

---

### **COORDINATION**
- **This progress tracker** is for detailed completion documentation
- **Checklist** is for quick status updates and brief notes
- **Main roadmap** remains the authoritative source for execution instructions

>**NO OTHER REPORTING, TRACKING, OR DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED FOR A ROADMAP**
