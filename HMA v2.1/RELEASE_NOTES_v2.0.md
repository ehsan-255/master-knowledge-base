---

## üöß Breaking Changes

**None.** HMA v2.0 is fully backward compatible with v1.3 implementations. All changes are additive enhancements that do not break existing interfaces or patterns.

### Compatibility Notes
- Existing v1.3 plugins work without modification
- Adding manifest.json enables v2.0 features
- Core interfaces remain unchanged
- Migration can be performed incrementally

---

2. **Phase 2**: Observability standards (OTEL integration)
3. **Phase 3**: Contract validation (JSON Schema, OpenAPI)
4. **Phase 4**: Plugin standardization (manifest files)
5. **Phase 5**: Validation and optimization

### Timeline
- **Complete migration**: 10 weeks
- **Team effort**: 2-3 engineers, part-time
- **Business impact**: Minimal, primarily additive

### Support
