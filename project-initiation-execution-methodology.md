## Project Overview

I aim to develop a comprehensive problem-solving framework applicable across diverse domains of problems, for example, large-scale software engineering projects, mathematical equations, advanced physics problems, code architecture, and even very simple everyday tasks such as travel planning, shopping, task management, cooking, etc. 

Initially, I constructed an ad hoc methodology; however, I soon identified significant deficiencies, including inconsistencies and logical gaps. These issues arose primarily because I did not have a comprehensive methodology framework and did not follow a systematic proven methodology for *brainstorming*, *planning*, *breaking down complex problems (decomposing)*, and *managing* projects from start to finish. 

Now, I want to step back and work on creating a comprehensive methodology framework that combines all the **proven scientific** methodologies, historical methodologies, and best practices, for *brainstorming*, *understanding the problem*, *identifying the critical unknowns of the problem*, *asking the right questions*, *exploring the problem's depth and breadth*, *planning*, *breaking down its complexity (decomposing)*, *crafting a solution methodologically*, *creating an implementation plan (roadmap)*, and even *executing the plan from start to finish*. 
 
The goal is to have a versitile methodology that's so robust and flexible that no matter how large or complex a problem is, this **formulated methodology** will automatically solve and guide through **a complete solution**. 

In order to generate this formulated methodology, the following may help:

1. **Complete Problem-Solving Methodology Research and Selection**
   Conduct comprehensive research to identify and evaluate evidence-based methodologies and historical attempts to generate a universal problem-solving methodology, categorize them by their pros and cons, points of failure and break throughs. Review peer-reviewed literature and documented best attempts to establish a comprehensive library of methodologies.

2. **Partial Problem-Solving Methodology Research and Selection**
   Conduct comprehensive research to identify and evaluate evidence-based methodologies specific to each step of the problem-solving process. From *brainstorming*, *understanding the problem*, *identifying the critical unknowns of the problem*, *asking the right questions*, *exploring the problem's depth and breadth*, *planning*, *breaking down its complexity (decomposing)*, *crafting a solution methodologically*, *creating an implementation plan (roadmap)*, and even *executing the plan from start to finish*. 

3. **Methodology Synthesis and Integration**  
   Only after completion of the previous steps, select optimal methodological approaches through either:
    a. Implementation of a singular best-fit methodology, or
    b. Development of a hybrid methodology synthesizing complementary approaches to maximize effectiveness

## The Vision: A Complete Unified Methodology

The goal is to design a dynamic and flexible system that can adapt to any type of problem. This system will undoubtedly be a very complex algorithm, combining the best of scientific methodologies, and best practices, tailorable to any type of problem complexity and scale. 

We aren't currently focusing on coding, but rather on the conceptual framework of the system. This process **MUST BE** designed in a way that will allow it and even specifies the main architecture of the system to be easily developed as a software system in the near *future*.
