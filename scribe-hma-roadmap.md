- **Brief Description:** Create the logic that matches file content against rule triggers.
‚¨ú ###### ACTION 2.1.2.1: Develop Rule Matching Logic

---

‚¨ú ### STEP 2.2: Action Plugin System & Security
- **Brief Description:** Develop the plugin architecture for actions and implement critical security guardrails.

---

‚¨ú **üèÅ STEP 2.2 EXIT CONDITIONS**: [Step 2.2 Completion Criteria]

- **Brief Description:** Add a failure isolation mechanism to the engine.
‚¨ú ###### ACTION 2.2.3.1: Write Circuit Breaker Class
